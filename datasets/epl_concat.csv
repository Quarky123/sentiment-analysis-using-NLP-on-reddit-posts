"and if so, when is it going  away?

I've been following the Premier League since summer 2007 and I can't count how many times I've read in English papers or club forums or even on reddit of how players new to the Premier League are judged so damn quickly. THat if you scored 100 league goals in 4 seasons in SPain or won 3 league titles in Serie A, none of it matters if you don't hit the ground running. And however you may perform, it reflects 100% on the league you were in prior. 

&amp;#x200B;

just so strange. maybe it occurs the same level of egotistical thinking in other top leagues.","If you perform poorly or outright ""flop"" in the Premier League, this invalidates whatever successes you may have had in Serie A or La Liga or the Bundesliga. Is this sorta thinking still around"
"Maybe it's just because there's indeed a gulf between the leagues. I'm thinking of guys like Hahnemann at Reading or Schmeichel at Leicester City or Henderson at Sheffield United. They were rock stars for their promoted sides and showed they belonged their first season in the PL. 

Reading made history in the 05-06 season in the CHampionship and Hahnemann was integral to that.  I wanna say in 06-07, he had an insane number of saves and was statistically among the best keepers in of the top 5 leagues that season.",I feel that often keepers of promoted sides tend to be massively underrated in their first season in the Premier League.
"So I’m hearing that Scott Carson has tested positive for covid. Which leaves Man City short on GK for the game today against Man United. 

My problem I have with this is down to the fact that certain city players have breached the UK laws around covid and as a result contracted the disease and allegedly now infected other team players ans also the coaching staff. 

Now here is where I have the issue. The game will be suspended and replayed at a later stage. Why ? This inconveniences Manchester United who are ready to play the game. Yet city have failed to keep a track of their players who are getting payed hundreds of thousand of pound just to follow the bloody rules. Where the rest of the country are struggling to put food on the table and now have to stay locked down in the homes. Not mansions with acres of land to run around in. The premier league are also putting in millions to ensure everyone is tested regularly and to ensure that football can keep playing to the rest of us normal folk can have a little enjoyment of having the football on while we are stuck inside. 

A fine is not good enough. If players cannot take responsibility then they should be punished with a ban and the club has either to forfeit the game or field a weakened side. It has to black and white otherwise these players will continue to disrupt the game snd act they are invincible. 

This game has to go ahead tonight and it’s the same for any other future games where this instance takes place.

"So Reguillon (and Lamela, Lanzini and Lo Celso) all broke the lockdown rules by having a party on Christmas Day). Now just approx 2 weeks later Reguillon has assisted the possibly winning goal in the EFL Cup SF. For doing something illegal he has been fined by Spurs but nothing else has happened.

Given how Cavani was fined £100,000 and banned for 3 games because he said one word that was deemed inappropriate, why is it that a group of players can break the UK and the biggest punishment they face is a fine that is likely what they earn in a week or even less.

Surely a 3, 5 or even 10 match ban would be suitable for breaking COVID rules otherwise loads of players will continue to do it and potentially stop the pl because they could be spreading COVID to all teams.

PS: I know that as a Brentford fan that I’m biased but if Ivan Toney or any of our best players went out I would be criticising them for it and I wouldn’t change my mindset.


Edit: I didn’t account on getting this many replies so I’ll address the main points that people are saying:

-I completely forgot about Walker and obviously the same principle should be applied to him.

-I thought that it was bad on behalf of the FA before the match for letting Reguillon with no punishment (aside from one issued by Spurs) and I made this post after he assisted a goal because I saw the irony in this.

"Last I checked defence is part of football. And a highly under appreciated discipline. You cant expect every team to turn in a highly aggressive attacking football against every team, especially with the way the schedule is. Look at Leeds. All I hear, even when they lose 3-0, is that they’re fun to watch. But at what cost? I highly doubt any Leeds fans actually enjoying their play week in week out when they lose to teams despite playing beautifully. Sometimes you gotta adapt and sit back to get the three points that you need. Which is what Southampton did. Which is what Spurs have been doing. And perhaps more teams should be doing so as to adapt to the tight schedule.

"In the season so far, the off-side calls made by VAR have been the topic of many discussions because it has determined the outcome of many games. 
Adding to this, I have a question:
They spend a lot of effort (drawing perpendicular lines, zooming in, and looking at different camera angles) to see if a person is behind or in front of a defender, but it seems as though they don't spend the same amount of effort to determine WHEN the ball is kicked. When, exactly, is the balled considered as being kicked? 

I suppose it is the moment the ball leaves the kicker's foot? But shouldn't they spend the same amount of effort to find this exact moment and then freeze the frame and move to where the person is on-side or off-side? To me, this moment is just as important as the millimeters they look at at goalside.",VAR: The ball leaving the foot
"So I've spent most of this season so far looking at ways to quantify how much teams have improved/worsened since last season as a way of analysing performance. I had gotten very tired with the general approach of saying ""x team had this many points at this stage last season!"" because that doesn't factor in any way, the order that the fixtures have come in. For example, West Ham started this season with an incredibly difficult run of fixtures and that should have been reflected in any comparisons to performance from last season early on.

Anyhow, this is what I've arrived at thus far.

The algorithm for deciding the final number takes in a lot of different factors ranging from performance, outcome and result data points. I'm always updating it so the table is often being rebalanced but those changes are usually incredibly subtle and affect the final numbers by small amounts.

"1. Liverpool: Become first back to backside to win the title since Man city did with 17/18 to 18/19 while doing without arguably their best player which is just incredible thinking about it 
2. Manchester United: Wins their first title since 2013 and Burno Fernandes shoots up to become a top 8 player on the planet and the best midfielder in the world while Rashford boost up to the top 30 and Ole gets in the top half of mangers in Europe by far and properly this would be their first title win that is totally unexpected from the start
3. Leicester City: It's been five years since their last title win in 2016 which is the greatest achievement in football history winning the premier league in the fashion that they did. but if they do it again then I feel like it would more impressive considering the fact that the quality of the league and the parity feels so much higher then a couple of years ago and Jamie Vardy legacy right now would be one of the most unique in football history considering winning two titles with two totally different styles with two totally different mangers and supporting casts as while his current ranking would shoot up to top 20 to top 15 in the world and a definite top ten striker in the world
4. Tottenham: This feel like a once in a lifetime opptumuinty to win a title in such a wide-open race as Harry Kane has been on another planet lately as Son has become his robin to his batman as he tries to break the assist record for most in premier league history and try to win a golden boot as well. if they win a title then Jose Mourihino's legacy just becomes that much better considering the rock bottom point that he had with Manchester United at the end of 2018. Harry Kane winning his first major trophy would make him a top 5 player in the world without a doubt and the conversation between Kane vs Lewy become a lot tighter than a lot of people think while Son becomes a top 15 player in the world. 
5. Manchester City: I'm not going to lie to you that this man city is a lot more pragmatic than another season by a pretty big margin because pep had to sure up the woeful defense of last year with a lot more rigid and old school approach which got them off to a very slow start which hit rock bottom this season with shocking 5-2 loss at home against Leicester City, but picked back up to this point where they had their best performances by far versus Chelsea which in the first half ripped them into shreds in under 40 mins scoring three goals which 6 or 7 honestly which tells me that they ready to sneak up on Liverpool or whoever at the top in the new few weeks and take their spot through the more defensive-minded approach which scores far fewer goals, but could potentially be the reason that they win their third title in 5 years which for pep will further cement his legacies as a top ten coach of all time period despite all of the money that he has spent and Kevin De Bryune will ended be remember as a premier league legend and the best midfielder of last 5-10 years. 

This season has been so many wild highs and lows that whatever I am saying right now could be null and void in a couple of weeks time and who knows whoever wins this title will be remembered for a very long time as properly one of if not the craziest title races of all time of all of football recent history by far and honestly as a Chelsea fan who properly out of races seeing current results lately go bad, I am just crazy ride ahead honestly",What does a Premier League title do for each of the top 5 teams for their legacies as a whole?
"1. In 2004, Porto was the only champion outside of the four major leagues in the new century. The stars in the array were Deco, Carvalho, and coach Mourinho.

2. In 2005, Liverpool, who was struggling in the Premier League very hard, had a mediocre lineup (I just left Irving, Torres did not come). The stars with a small median are Gerrard and Alonso who have not fully grown up.

3. In 2007, AC Milan, Sheva left, the main lineup is too old, and already has the prototype of Milan nursing home (Inzaghi, Maldini, Dida, Cafu, Gattuso, Seedorf are not young), but The opened Super Kaka saved the Milan pension team, head coach Ancelotti

4. In 2012, Chelsea, Mourinho's team's final peak and craziness, (Lampard, Terry, Drogba, Cech, Essien, the central axis is very old), Torres is in no state, the beginning of the season Boas messed up the Chelsea locker room even more.

"A lot of people including me will say yes to this question. Henderson and Fabinho are playing as their CB's and they are missing the flair in the midfield. Who would they sign

SAMUEL GIGOT
Samuel Gigot is a French CB from Spartak Moscow who is 6'3"" and 27 years of age. Spartak are 3rd after 19 games (10/5/4) with 21 goals conceded which is 1.10 goals conceded per game. Gigot has also popped up with 3 goals in the Russian League and could be a half decent mid-term signing. Liverpool have also conceded 21 goals this season but in 2 less games which is 1.23 goals conceded per game. Based off stats, Gigot would be a great addition

JEROME BOATENG
Jerome Boateng is a signing that is much more money than  Samuel Gigot but is a much better player. The German may be in his Late 20's and Early 30's but is one of the most decorated footballers in the history of the game. 2 UCLs, 2 Super Cups, 2 Club World Cups, 8 Bundesligas, 5 German Cups and the World Cup, he's won everything in Germany but can he win anything in England?",Should Liverpool sign a new CB

"**Arsenal: David Alaba**. This might be a bit unrealistic, but Alaba is most likely leaving Bayern. If Arsenal can beat Real and others to the player, he would massively improve Arsenal in the form of a center back and being great cover in defensive midfield and at left back, with Tierney and Ceballos both massively underperforming this season, although Tierney has had a few decent games recently. Another option might be Maximillian Arnold, a great midfielder with the capabilities to execute Arteta's vision

**Aston Villa: Jack Harrison**. I hate this fact because I'm a Leeds fan, but a front line consisting of Harrison, Watkins, and Grealish would be arguably the best front 3 outside of the big 6. Harrison is a quality playmaker who can bring what Ross Barkley doesn't bring, and therefore push Aston Villa to do better.

**Brighton: Joao Moutinho**. Brighton right now are a team that, under the right leadership, could actually surprise a few people. A decent defense, decent attack, but a midfield which could use a lot of reinforcement. It's not like Potter doesn't have them playing good football, for example Tariq Lamptey's goal against Spurs (which should not have stood), but Adam Lallana isn't the best creative base for a team gunning for mid table security. Moutinho might not have age on his side, but he's definitely a player that can improve Brighton. A little work on patching up the defense would be useful as well, although that's more a tactical problem than a technical one.

**Burnley: Eddie Howe**. For an actual suggestion though, **Josh King** would add some much needed pace and tooth into a very poor attacking team. Still won't change anything if Dyche tries to make Dwight McNeil dribble the ball from his penalty area to the midfield line then boot it forwards to the attack, but Burnley fans can pray,

**Chelsea: Raphaël Guerreiro**. In my post a few days ago, I preached the importance of not signing big name players who only are that big because they scored 2 penalties and a tap-in to bring their team to the UCL quarter finals before a ""tragic"" 6-1 aggregate loss to Bayern where the player didn't even touch the ball once. Guerreiro actually has talent, something rare in a signing worth over 10m in the EPL. He's proven his abilities at Dortmund, and with Chillwell flopping, he's an escape route. Right now, I'm not sure he's the best signing. Try out Chillwell, and if not him then Marcos Alonso. But if Chillwell is a certifiable flop, Guerreiro is a talent proven by years of hard work at a big club.

**Crystal Palace: Divock Origi**. Any striker worth more than 5m would be a lifesaver for this club. Wilfried Zaha and Eze are being drowned by the lack of playmakers and strikers around them, or at least quality ones. Luka Milojevic works decently in the midfield, Guaita at the back, but you need 2 strikers to run a 4-4-2 system, and I'm only seeing one. Origi isn't the worst striker, although definitely overhyped by Liverpool fans, so why not him? Other options are Salomon Rondon, Arkadiusz Milik, and Jamie Tartt (don't look him up the show will probably make any proper englishman want to die but everybody else finds it nice).

**Everton: Christian Eriksen**. He's played terribly at Inter. He has absolutely no justification playing at a good team again. But Everton do need a decent deep lying playmaker to complement James, DCL, and Richarlison (amongst others). Eriksen is a definite outside option for it. He would definitely be a great player for Ancelotti to have and experiment with, and can change Everton for the better if he returns to his Spurs form.

**Fulham: Pablo Fornals**. Outside option, definitely. But if Fulham can get him, he would inject the midfield with some quality. Lookman isn't the best in the world at penalties, Mitrovic hasn't been clinical, but the midfield is arguably the absolute worst in the Premier League. Fornals would be a realistic, cheap option who could actually help them.

**Leeds United: Igor Zubeldia**. I didn't want to be unoriginal and just say Puig, so I went with Zubeldia.  He's not necessarily a replacement for Phillips or a center back, more as a player who can play anywhere in that region to compensate for the insane amount of injuries they've been picking up.

**Leicester City: Troy Parrot**. Spurs will be reluctant to let him up, but there's no question that Vardy's getting older. That isn't to say Vardy is no longer Premier League quality: I would still call him top 10 strikers in the league if not top 5. However, it isn't wise to rest your hopes on a 33 year old. My suggestion is to sign Parrot and maybe another more proven striker and develop them while Vardy can still work as their first choice to have a good backup in good time.

**Liverpool: Dayot Upamecano**. Good center back to cover for the injuries. If not a purchase then a loan with option to buy. Pretty simple.

**Man City: Kingsley Coman**. Goals needed. Goalscorer of UCL winning goal and treble winner. Outside shot, could become excellent under Pep. If he doesn't instantly take to the EPL though expect many ""flop"" messages.

**Man United: James Justin**. The easy choice for this would be a Pogba replacement. However, I personally think Donny van de Beek is the best option to replace him. James Justin is an outside shot for the left back position, which definitely needs reinforcement with Luke Shaw being the only/best option there. Brandon Williams is nothing compared to Justin, who's had a decent season at Leicester.

**Newcastle United: Ben White**. If Ashley actually opens his wallet for the first time in millenia (barring last summer), Ben White could reinforce the back line at Newcastle to push them even further from the relegation zone. Could cost them upwards of 30m, so a cheaper option may be needed

**Sheffield United: Juan Mata**. This would be a desperate signing without a doubt, but it might actually work. If Wilder can stomach changing to a new system and allowing Mata to be their main playmaker, it might not leave them last. Not saying they would survive, but Mata is a realistic signing who could provide some temporary relief or at the very least a win.

**Southampton: Sergio Romero**. Not to say that Southampton's goalkeepers are not EPL quality, but to be up at the top they need a stronger goalie. Romero doesn't instantly come to mind, but the stats back him to be the best backup goalie in practically the world.

**Spurs: Julian Weigl**. He is the perfect Mourinho player. He can work in the midfield or at the back, young but old enough to be in his prime, and would be perfect cover at Spurs for Alderweireld and Hojberg. 

**West Brom: Olivier Giroud**. Unlikely. But West Brom need a good striker desperately and Lampard's delusions about Tammy at striker and Werner at the wing means it could actually be done. Goals are needed and he can provide them.

**West Ham: John Brooks**. Not particularly great, but a good center back to keep West Ham from conceding goals, which would be much appreciated considering their lack of effective center backs.

**Wolves: Thilo Kehrer**. Seeing Kilman at CB is great considering my widespread condemnation of it (youth talents getting efficient game time) not happening enough, but it also means it's the easiest spot for me to improve so I'm going to be a hypocrite just this once and any other time I see fit. Thilo Kehrer has flown under the radar of impressive young talents, not seeming out of place at one of the biggest teams in Europe. Kilman could definitely still develop and maybe even compete with Kehrer, but either way an improvement would be made.

Harry Kane also is the first player in Europe’s top leagues, and I also believe all of professional world football to reach 10 goals and 10 assists this season. 

I’m amazed at how Kane can turn into a playmaker instantly but other times be such a prolific goalscorer. Heung-Min Son has scored a lot of goals too this season thanks to Kane. I still  can’t wrap my head around the fact that the pair have linked up 13 times in half a season, and the striker has gotten more of the assists.

"Just saw some post on this subreddit saying ""Why isnt Pep Guardiola getting any criticsm?"". Maybe because its not his fault? When theres a problem at a football club, you dont just point fingers at the manager unless if hes actually the problem. Is the most decorated manager in history the problem? Or is it the simple fact that your attack just forgot how to finish? Pep Guardiola isnt a puppet master. Hes not the one whos supposed to be scoring into an open net from 2 yards out (Im looking at you Raheem). And its not just that, you actually have City fans who want Pep out. Have they forgot all hes done for them? 100 point season, back to back prems, and fourmidables? 

You also got Mikel Arteta, he came in and instantly transformed Arsenals playstyle. They went on to beat some of the best teams and won 1 and a half trophy (yes, im talking about the community shield. cant count that as a full trophy). He started the season quite shit, but does form not exist for managers? Aubameyang has scored like 1 goal all season and you dont see Arsenal fans saying he should fuck off. Artetas doing good now as well. This was a problem with Unai Emery as well. He almost got them a top 4 finish, had that unbeaten run for a fair amount of time for Arsenal, took them to a Europa League final then the fans turned on him and he lost all his confidence. And his players turned on him as well. Its not gonna get better no shit.

Arteta first cuz he won 2 trophies in 8 months unlike the other two who have none. Arsenal was internally and morally chaotic when he first took charge as well. He also has the best H2H record amongst the two managers(vs Ole: 2 meetings WW.  vs Lampard: 4 meetings LDWW). Also for some extra icing, Arteta has a better win record against Klopp than anyone listed(4 meetings WWLW). That's pretty good for someone who only managed a team for 10 months(that's when Arteta last met Klopp) in his managerial career.

&amp;#x200B;

Ole second cuz although he doesn't have any silverware he is currently 2nd place in the prem, placing better than Arteta and Lampard currently. He also got United to 3rd last season with a masterclass signing of Bruno(what a player)

&amp;#x200B;

Lampard last place by a mile cuz his only decent achievement was reaching the FA cup final and finishing 4th last season in the league. He spent 250M to sit 8th. Arteta and Ole would most likely perform better if they got that sort of backing.

"Just seen the penalty United have been given against Villa and hear Gary Neville praising Paul Pogba for being clever for taking a fall once Douglas Luiz puts his arm on him and honestly it’s so infuriating to see football reduced to this. We see some fantastic players get praised for being clever and falling under minimal contact (and it’s all clubs there’s no bias here, we see it from Salah, Kane, Fernandes and Vardy on a consistent basis) and rather than see it being called out and criticised, pundits are now praising it and calling it intelligent play. 

I don’t think I would mind VAR if it actually resulted in these calls being ruled out, but I feel VAR with its constant replaying and zooming of minimal frames if anything gives more free kicks and penalties for any theatrics like this. Of course this isn’t a VAR issue, a rule change needs to be implemented to fix this and actually punish players for this (seriously what happened to booking players who dive?)",Can we stop praising players for being clever for taking a dive?

"For example, Werner. He scored 28 goals last season in a system built for him. You could see a large amount of his goals coming from his breakaway abilities. Meanwhile, Lampard has him playing as a left winger half the time. He doesn't have the same effect, even if he has the attributes for it. Havertz is being talked about being a flop as well, even though he's been injured half the time and not performed all too poorly in general. This has been happening for a while, with Morata and Keita and so many others at other teams. Just because you have one good season doesn't mean you have the best passing range in Europe. Just because you work well in one system in one league doesn't mean the same is true for another system in another league. People should stop complaining when a player isn't instantly the best at their team when they were hyping up their potential instead of their abilities. This has happened time and time again. 

Instead of signing your Havertzs and Werners and Moratas who have just had a great season under a different system, instead consider signing somebody like Mendy who has a proven track record outside of media attention. Somebody like Luuk de Jong could probably score 10+ EPL goals a season but he's not talked about because he hasn't played for a ""big team"" yet even though he has a Europa League title under his belt. Julian Weigl could probably act as a midfield pivot for any team outside of the biggest few, but he's not talked about because he didn't ""reach his potential"" at Dortmund. Wout Weghorst hasn't been talked about at all in footballing circles even though he's led his team by scoring 9 in 13 in the Bundesliga, and is now starting to see some transfer rumors to Spurs. Let me predict what his career will be like if he makes this move: He'll join them, be unable to break through the Kane-Son dynamic, be called a ""flop"" because he scored once in the 5 games he was provided since Troy Parrot received more attention than him, build his career back at the age of 30 in a different league or at a lower level team like Crystal Palace, and eventually will be known as ""that guy who flopped at Spurs"" even though his career was so much bigger than that. This has been my Ted Talk/Rant, thank you for listening","Stop hyping players up and then feeling let down when they ""flop"""

Spurs: 3.83 (none)

Why are they able to get away with it? Is that the only way to get a foul call in the Prem now? Is it on the refs? Is it on the players for being soft and going to ground way too easily?

But for a coach that’s just spent 200m, you’ve got to be pushing for top 2 by Christmas.

"It's Mourinho's inability to recognise a problem on the pitch if it concerns his favourite players. Kane and Son should not have played that much. Or at all tbh. They've both looked increasingly poorer and slower recently, they clearly need a rest. Vinicius has done a job in Europa. Lamela, Moura and Bergwijn can do jobs on the wings. Alli can do a job as a second striker. They had no choice but to defend for 90 minutes because the attack was so poor. If that was Dele Alli playing like that he'd have come off in the first half.

As soon as Ndombele went off they had no chance. He's the only one that could hold up a ball up there. What was the point of not playing him at all against Leicester when they actually needed him, for him to only play 60 minutes again tonight? And having both Hojbjerg and Winks sit even when in possession when they're playing 3 at the back as well is ridiculous. They were clearly missing an extra man going forward.

"Who’ve been your signings of the season for PL clubs? In no particular order, mine go...

Gabriel (Arsenal) - Currently looks like Arsenal’s only competent defender, you’d shudder to imagine  where they’d be without him. 

Watkins (Villa) - Really great all around striker, strong, fast and a great finisher on the ground or in the air. Spearheads Villa’s attack better than Wesley or Samatta and looks a menace whenever he’s on the pitch. 

Torres (City) - Really young, great fee and looks like becoming a star already under Guardiola. 

Martinez (Villa) - Villa’s unsung hero this season and maybe the most consistent shot-stopper in the league behind Alisson, Martinez makes you wonder why Chelsea didn’t go for him over Mendy. 

Allan (Everton) - The perfect anchor to a midfield containing more attacking options and one of the best DMs in Europe for almost 5 years, all for less than €30m. Only nitpick is his age, but for such a low fee he still makes it in. 

Lookman (Fulham) - Has looked absolutely electric for Fulham this season. Seemed underwhelming as a loan deal, but at this rate Fulham and every club in England should be vying to get him out of Leipzig this Summer. Huge key pass and dribble numbers and bear in mind that he’s still only 23. 

Fofana (Leicester) - Huge fee but for a 19-year old I don’t think anyone could have expected him to slot straight in to a top-4 challenging defense. Really astute signing shows that Leicester have still got it when looking for incredibly talented youth. 

Jota (Liverpool) - 12 goals and 2 assists in under 1200 league/UCL/cup minutes. Liverpool are lucky they didn’t go for Ismaila Sarr instead. 

Thiago (Liverpool) - Not had much of a chance to show it yet, but the best midfielder in the world for €30m is an unreal bargain. 

Hojbjerg (Spurs) - Exactly what Spurs needed in the midfield. Hojbjerg adds some steel to a midfield commonly criticized for being soft, as well as a great range of passing and an assured touch when in possession. When you consider that the deal basically works out to €3m + Kyle Walker-Peters, it’s a slam dunk. 

Coufal (West Ham) - The second acquisition from Slavia Prague in as many windows, Coufal’s strength and defensive mettle makes you wonder what other bargains are there to be had outside of Europe’s top 5 leagues.

Thiago Silva (Chelsea) - Added in by popular demand and due to the fact I completely overlooked him, Silva has provided maturity and stability to a young Chelsea side for the low cost of his wages.",Signings of the Season

"I include realistically because while we would all love to sign Van Dijk Neuer Lewandowski Ronaldo and Ramos, that might be a bit of a stretch 😅

As a city fan, after watching most of our games this season, especially the last couple, it seems straightforward enough. We need someone who can finish chances with 100% consistency. Sterling Torres Mahrez Bernardo are all phenomenal players but in their instinct, as wingers who often assist, they can’t be called upon to finish chances as much as we need. As a result we throw away anywhere from 1-3 scoreable chances a game. 

I think the idea signing for us would be a clinical forward, perhaps someone like Martinez?

"I love Frank Lampard and he's my second favorite player of all time behind Didier Drogba. I have wanted him to succeed this whole time and still do. Nothing would make me happier than him succeeding as manager and Chelsea winning the league with him. However, as a lifelong Chelsea fan I will always put the success of my club first. Multiple players mentioned that they chose to come to Chelsea due to Frank Lampard being here (Werner, Havertz and even Haaland said something along those lines). I believe he did a great job last year making it to the FA Cup Final (we should have won that) and finishing in the Top 4 with a transfer ban. We spent 250+ million this summer on absolutely brilliant players (Werner = 2 most goal contributions in Bundesliga, Havertz = one of the most highly touted young players in the world, Ziyech = someone who should have come to the Prem long ago, Chilwell = a top left back in the Prem, Mendy = stop gap goalkeeper and Silva = aging but still top level CB). We came into this season knowing that the plan was to close the gap on Liverpool and Man City this season and have top 4 and trophy as a BARE MINIMUM. We started this season with Kepa in goal and struggled even though we were playing teams that should not cause us problems (outside of Liverpool of course). Me and other fans made excuses about Kepa's mistakes and injuries against West Brom, Southampton and Liverpool. We went on a 17 game unbeaten streak while performing well in Europe and everyone was gassed up and claiming we were realistic title challengers and potentially UCL winners. Meanwhile nobody realized that none of the teams we beat were in the top 10 of the league. Then we had a shocker against Everton and Wolves, which in my opinion exposed the weakness of Lampard's tactics. We consistently play Timo on the wing (he's not a fucking winger and sucks there.. it's plain for everyone to see), we haven't played Kai in the correct position all season (he's a 10) and we INSIST on crossing the ball when we play Tammy up top (who can't win a header for his life.. look at the Spurs, Krasnodar, Arsenal games). Lampard's substitutions also make absolutely no sense, we didn't bring on Giroud when he's not only on form but also all we're doing is crossing for example (34 crosses, he also had Timo, Tammy and Giroud all on the field at the same time in one game). He also played a 50% Reece James and Ben Chilwell who were injured when we have a proven albeit aging RB in Azpi (our club captain btw) and Emerson who played absolutely fine against West Ham. He brought on Jorginho who doesn't progress the ball and played poor against West Ham as well. We are 15 points behind where we were at this point last season as well. I could say much more if anyone else is curious but this is a novel at this point.",Lampard Out (except there are no top managers really available anymore): And this is why...

The title says it all really. Some of the decisions that VAR have made have been to microscopic.

IMO if the kind of measurement being made by VAR are so miniscule as to barely affect the reaction time of the players in any way then it shouldn't called. A tolerance limit should be set wherein if a player is off by a certain distance then he should be allowed the benefit of the doubt.,VAR should have a tolerance limit.

"Now, I know what you are thinking - just pick the best 18, right? Well, not necessarily. I can choose a heavily attacking side with Sterling, Mahrez, Salah, Rashford, Mane, Bruno, Son and Kane, but is this team realistically outscoring the opponent for 38 games? No, there needs to be some strategy into choosing the best all-around team. Plus, for the sake of it being more interesting, you gotta think about non-quantifiable factors like - who will be the big start, who will be pulling the strings in the midfield, are you gonna pick very offensive wing backs and if yes - maybe a CDM extra to cover the spaces behind them?   


Rules for participating:

* **Max 3 players per team -** the idea is not to pick Liverpool's team and add De Bryune and Maguire (haha)
* **Pick the formation you want -** 3-4-3, 4-4-2, anything you would like to play 
* **It's based on players right now, not their potential -** picking a team of the Lampteys, Curtis Joneses and Pedro Netos of the world would be fun but realistically they are not breaking the record 

No more rules - let's play! 

**Starting 11:**

1. **GK - Alisson -** Alisson wins us 15 points by himself, just making those 1 or 2 sensational saves per game that keep us in a game/save us a tight game. Very easy choice. 
2. **RB - Kyle Walker -** provides defensive stability, can play as the right CB in a back three and on offence can still produce, albeit not as much as Trent Alexander Arnold. Walker is the man for the right.
3. **CB - Conor Coady -** I will never not say that he is one of the best CBs in the league. In a back 4 they could be sensational.
4. **CB - Virgil Van Dijk -** I mean, when he's playing he is the best CB in the world. Remember, people were saying he was better than Messi. That's insane for a defender.
5. **LB - Ben Chilwell -** this season for Chelsea he was even better than last year, capable on the back and as dangerous as ever on the front.
6. **CDM - N'Golo Kante -** having infront of these 4 basically locks my defence. It's unplayable - Kante's there and then if you pass by him you face a wall. These defence alone is getting 27 to 30 clean sheets. 
7. **CM - Paul Pogba -** not only Kante locks the defence, but he unlocks Pogba. Example? Look no further than World Cup 2018 where Pogba and Kante played together and we all saw what happened. 
8. **CM - Kevin De Bryune -** basically have De Bryune be the more offensive midfielder out of the three.
9. **RW - Mohamed Salah -** for me Salah is the second best player in the Premier League and the best right wing in the world. Look at his numbers - since joining Liverpool probably only Messi and Lewa have more goals than him. 
10. **LW - Heung-Min Son -** what can I say - he is different. With these passers he gets three, four chances per game and with his ratio of goals/shots, that guarantees goals.
11. **ST - Jamie Vardy -** I know Harry Kane plays in the PL, but again, with this passing Vardy will get so many chances. He is also way better in a possession play than people think.

**Reserves:**

1. **Nick Pope -** so underrated. Nick Pope filling in for Alisson sounds like a dream.
2. **Thiago Silva -** the idea of Silva being on the bench is that he is quite old so I don't want him to play every game. Rotate the starting two, start every other game. When he plays he is always dominant. 
3. **Reece James -** perfect choice from the bench to give Walker some air. 
4. **Jack Grealish -** someone parked the bus against us, it's 75th minute and it's 0-0, what do we do? Easy, put Grealish in and he will find the gap in the opponent's defence.
5. **Raheem Sterling -** Son terrorized the opponent's right back in the first half, he is tired and has a yellow. And now he will defend against a well-rested Sterling for 45 minutes! Yikes.
6. **Harry Kane -** this bench is making me feel anxious for the other side. Kane from the bench? What?
7. **Wilfried Ndidi -** Kante will cover a lot for the attacking players and he needs to have a player coming off the bench to cover for him.

With this my side is finished. In a normal game you have De Bryune and Pogba pushing balls forward to the three speedsters and if the opponent parks the bus, you can put Grealish in to empty pockets, Sterling to make them uncomfortable and Harry Kane to annihilate.

"I'll be honest, I now try to avoid anything on twitter specifically, but also media response to Leeds matches as a whole. While it's nice to watch the praise for wins, some of the opinions and views of pundits, fans of other teams and even Leeds fans, just hurt my head. So I wanted to put my honest views on everything Leeds related, just to see what other Leeds fans think, if anyone agrees/disagrees, but also what other fans of other teams think.

To start with, in all honesty the expectation from the media for Leeds this season took me by surprise. Sure, we play exciting football, and having watched it for over 2 years it's become normal though I'm reminded watching other team's games how good the football is (don't get me wrong, losing is still losing and not a great feeling, but as for the quality of football and excitement when I watch, it's great), but that doesn't mean we'll be a team challenging for Europe like I saw at the start of the season.From all honest Leeds fans (because we all have those crazy fans), our aim is, and always has been the same as any promoted from Championship. Survival. I'm not in a dream world as to the relaity of what we should expect to achieve as a team. I would take a goal difference survival, a couple points survival, hell, even a goal line technology malfunction survival (Just a joke Villa fans, nothing serious). After 16 years out of the Prem, where it was looking more and more likely we'd be forever a Championship team, with the odd upset in playoffs/scare of relegation to League 1, I want nothing more than to just stay in the Premier League.

As for the love Bielsa gets, it's all based on his footballing impact, not accolades and trophies. He has a clear style of play, and he implements it at every club he goes to, win, lose or spanking (As we saw on Sunday). I think a lot of that admiration from people for him gets mixed for expecting him to be making Leeds a team challenging the top 6 (Or so it feels). People aren't followers of him or lovers of him because he wins trophies and tactically outclasses managers left right and centre, but for the exciting and clear style no matter the opponent, and how he is football mad in every way. He's an intriguing manager, which a strange personality and a pure passion for football as a game. Manchester United's starting 11 cost around £400m, and Leeds's cost around £70m. You'd never expect to win that game with any manager, so it's no surprise we lost. I wouldn't choose to lose heavy but it will happen with how we play, Bielsa's coaching and play style doesn't work miracles to overturn teams with starting lineups over 5x the price of ours (although some would argue our promotion seemed like a miracle for the majority of Leeds fans). But it does allow us to see our team actually compete with these teams and look like we can score just as easily as anyone, despite the clear weakness in our squad. That is what I admire.

&amp;#x200B;

Our performances in the league this season haven't been much different to teams in previous years who've stayed up, so I'm understandably happy with how we've played, even with some of the losses we've taken. We're doing well in relation to our avoid relegation target, and that is what I find important. But there's plenty of football to play, and many points to be won/lost, so I'm not naive to the possibility of relegation, anything can happen, but as things stand we're on track.

For me personally, I use watching Leeds now more than ever as an escape from the real world, from the upset of being in a tier 4 area over Christmas, and stresses of working in a critical worker sector right through all the lockdowns. This year has been hard for everyone, each of us with our own struggles and battles, but I'm glad football can continue, and I'm even happier knowing I can watch us play like we do. I don't think we're 'better' than any team because of it, morally or tactically. I just enjoy the viewing pleasure of how the players have bought into the exciting playstyle, and I'll make the most of it even if it results in relegation. I am and always be a Leeds fan, and regardless of the outcome of the season, I'll always appreciate that Bielsa has sparked my interest in Leeds to its maximum I've experienced (As a 20yr old fan whose only ever remembered/experienced doom and gloom), and given us hope that we can get back to being a 'big' team some day, even if that is many many years down the line.

Diego Llorente 

Liam Cooper

Gaetano Beradi

But no, Bielsa is overated because our makeshift back line consisting of ONE player in his proper position costing a combined £5m conceded 6 to one of the most expensive squads in the world.

Wolves are one of the best ever promoted sides, right? Well Leeds have more points than they did at this point of the season. Leeds are just another Norwich? Leeds have scored 2 goals less than Norwich managed all of last season.

When VVD and Joe Gomez got injured, everybody mentioned the injury crisis at Liverpool, despite them still having one of the best centre backs in the league (Matip) and the best defensive midfielder in the league (Fabinho) still available to play.

People need to apply context before they speak, because it makes them look silly.",Why does nobody mention the injury crisis?

For any offside call with the difference between the last player and the opposite teams player being less than x mm, it should be a linesman call i.e. whatever the linesman ruled in real time.

Makes it even worse when you have teams with not even half of Arsenal's payroll miles ahead in terms of performance.

Even if things do get somewhat better as the season wears on (which I'm doubtful of), I think Arsenal should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.

Watching the United game and I’ve just seen Dan James get booked for a ‘dive’ even though it was clearly not a dive. Yet players like coady get away scot free with his clear dive against Liverpool. Why is inconsistency like this still so rife at the top level?,‘Diving’ in the premier league and serious inconsistency?

"One of the most interesting things I've noticed with now fans in the stadium (apart from the performances and lack of home advantage) is the stadium wraps, or seat covers, whatever you want to call them. But who has the best?

For me, even as a Liverpool fan through and through, I have to nominate Manchester United.

First and foremost, the full stadium wrap with not just the first tier of seats being wrapped, but the whole stadium. That added with a majority of the stadium being filled with pictures of fans that cannot make the game, gives a personal and fan friendly customisation that no other club really gives. And then with the HATRED (with the HAT crossed out to just spell red) along with other ""United against racism"" wraps that coordinates with the fight against racism campaign is a touch of class.

Side note: Wolves is a close second place with the fan pics, making a collage of players and management team.",What team has the best stadium wraps?
"Glad the concussion sub rule is coming in, fine with staying at 3 subs, but it got me thinking about other things that could be changed.

I’d like to see diving be penalised retroactively. I know in the NBA the referees review every decision (or non-decision) after the game, so if the same is done with football matches it should be pretty easy to identify dives (successful or otherwise). I think if you start handing out 1-match suspensions, players will be much less likely to dive.

I’d also like to see the 6-second rule actually be applied. This is in part to quell time wasting late on, but also just to speed up the play. Keepers take 10-15 seconds almost every time, more when they’re winning late on and go to ground after making a straightforward catch...I’d kinda like to see the how actually adhering to the rule affects play.

Finally, another one that’s already a rule but not implemented, I’d like to see bookings (and thus stopping players from doing it) when they stop a quick fee kick or throw. Like players commit a foul then grab the ball, or they just stand in front of the ball and stuff. I dunno, I’d like to see the game run more smoothly.

I think Arnold is a typical player promoted by the team system. This is difficult to verify. Because he has been in Liverpool. However, for the national team, he is not the main player, and he has not had any good performances.

What is a team? It can help you make up for your weaknesses. His strengths and weaknesses are very obvious, his strengths are bold offense and imaginative passing. The downside is that his defense is really bad. Many people can sieve him if he doesn't help him. Moreover, his bold pass itself is a risk for the team to change the ball. He has a lot of assists, but also missed a lot of passes, at least a lot more than Robertson.

"In my honest opinion I think it's such a close call, it really should benefit the attacker therefor onside. The check was very quick, they saw it was close and let it go, brilliant in that sense.

I honestly hope they continue to check like they did with this one. But if they now go back to zooming, drawing and checking toe nails for offside like before, it will show just another sign of inconsistent VAR  usage.

"I was watching back Aston Villa's highlights against Wolves.

At 5:25 in this video, John McGinn is fouled and a penalty awarded: [https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906](https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906)

In the video, you can clearly hear the sound of players colliding. Even as a Villa fan I thought there wasn't much contact at the time. I can completely imagine the ref using his ears as well as his eyes to make the decision. In this instance, it wasn't overturned.

However, there have been other penalty decisions overturned. Since lockdown, teams have mostly been playing in empty stadiums, where you can hear more of the action.

I wonder if referees are using their ears more to make decisions. Then, when reviewing the slowed-down footage (either at Stockley Park or pitchside), they no longer use that audio. From different angles, contact between two players can look better or worse.

My theory is that in some cases, referees see what looks like contact, and their ears confirm it for them. However, on review, and without audio, that's overturned.

If that is the case (and someone with access to stats could check it), then a lo-fi option would be to keep the audio during reviews (if they don't already). Sports like cricket use snick-o-meters to determine how much contact was made between bat and ball.

As crowds return the pitchside mics may pick up less, but keeping the audio could be a useful signal to officials trying to decide whether, and how much contact was made, especially when it's unclear from different camera angles.",Does lack of audio during reviews impact VAR decisions?

"The term sleepwalking towards disaster is well and truly applicable too Arsenal, from the days of consistently finishing 4th and gloating about it too now being an outright shambles, every step Arsenal have taken as a club has led them to this moment. From transfer strategy too management, everything is wrong structurally, and frankly with or without Mikel Arteta I think results wouldn’t be different. 

This is a problem that I believe could last up to a decade or beyond. I saw it with Liverpool (who probably started from a worse position in terms of squad and management before arriving too the brendan Rodgers and now loool era’s) and we can see it now with United where issues have remained permanently since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. 

The worst part is the Arsenal fans. Who have now reared there true ugly heads (IMO). They are completely spineless, this is just based on the differing reactions from Liverpool and United fans when there clubs had/have fallen into turmoil. One win gets blown out of proportion, and a loss is the end of there club. These run of results should act as a humbling, yes Arsenal are a “big club”, but I see no acceptance of the current situation. When Emery was in it was about getting rid of him to find a style and give an opportunity to the younger players, that was the Arteta plan. Now it’s again get rid of the manager, find a style and give a chance to the younger players. 

Xhaka has never been good enough, nor has elneny, mustafi or holding and get they consistently find themeselves with opportunities in the first team. Every player can play well for a short period of time but it’s inevitable that the flaws which hinder them from being truly elite players will rear themselves, which is perfectly fine, however Arsenal fans seem to disillusion themselves by a few good performances and then expect the good performance to become permanent.

"I know players looking for fouls is nothing new but this season it seems like it's happening constantly. Will be watching a game and it'll constantly be broken up by someone collapsing to the floor screaming cos they got poked and will win a foul or the ball will be kicked out to see if they're ok, even though they are completely fine and there was never enough enough contact for that.

I feel like players know especially with VAR that any contact no matter how minimal will result in a foul as long as they fall over, e.g. the Robertson foul on welbeck. Players have also stopped competing for aerial battles cos they know if the other player jumps they can get a foul by falling over and saying they jumped into them, Joe Roden did that like 3 or 4 times in the match against Chelsea. Idk if I'm just noticing it more but it definitely feels more common and its making games really shit to watch and there's no exciting physical battles.

"The top 6 matches in the PL are always hyped up for a  week and a lot of the time when it comes to the match it just turns into an absolute snore fest.

At the moment all the top 6 teams are so scared of slipping up in one of the big matches and so they don’t do anything risky and the end result is just a boring match that usually finishes 0-0 with most of the possession in midfield and hardly any attacking play.

In all honesty the only ‘exciting’ top 6 game was Spurs (6) vs Man Utd (1) and even that was boring in the way that it was so one-sided.

While United and Liverpool are rivals, I like watching United do well. Especially, in the Ferguson days, I felt like United could dig really deep for a result even when their players were having an off day - it kind of reminds of how Liverpool plays now. 

Ole is a strange one. Whenever I see him on the touch line or interviews, it seems as though he’s not in control of the team.  I’m finding it difficult to put it into words but it just seems different from his Cardiff days when it felt like he was in charge.

"Last season they were being tipped as outsiders for UCL at one point. Now they'll need a miracle to escape relegation. 11 games so far this season, only a singular point picked up. What has gone wrong?

An interesting point to start on is Sheffield's wage bill: Only Leeds United come close in how little is spent on player wages. They're currently around the $20m USD mark, upgrading $4-5m since last season. For reference, Mesut Özil's salary is about the same as the entire Sheffield United team. Phil Jagielka is their best paid player.

Tactically, Sheffield play a 5-at-the-back, with a formidable center 3 being key to their good results last season. However, this time around, injuries have hit hard. Jack O'Connell's statistics show how well Sheffield perform with and without him: Sheffield win 475% more games with him, get 3 times more points per game, and concede half the amount of goals. Attempts to move around players to fix this haven't worked: they lack physicality, awareness, and pure quality. It's easy to see just how hard this has affected Sheffield as a whole.

Up front as well, Lys Mousset's lack of performances has left Sheffield stranded. And no offense to everybody in Sheffield's attack, but they need to improve heavily if they want to survive this season. In winter, a striker needs to be signed who can finish goals. If Sheffield's defense can partially recover themselves, and the attack can be improved to get Sheffield playing at last season's level, perhaps they won't see themselves facing Championship teams next season",What's gone wrong at Sheffield United this season?

Lastly, what do you think is the biggest contributor to Arsenal performing so poorly?

I feel a managers duties are to put out the best side each and every performance while also maintaining so rest for players in big stretches. I also think they are there to motivate players and challenge them to grow in aspects of their game that need development. However, a manager can only do so much and as much as they want their to perform the best, they cant actually control how the team goes out and plays. I see a lot of Arsenal fans who want to blame Arteta for Arsenals performances and my question is just why do you think he's to blame? Is he not putting out the best lineup? Again, I feel its a bit harsh to throw all criticism at a manager because the players are the ones actually out their on the pitch and he cant control the fact that someone like Aubameyang hasn't scored a game time goal in however many matches its been.

"As another year soon comes to a close we see yet another year without the first openly gay Premier League player. This is not a problem most of us think about on a daily basis, but we really should.

Can you imagine? It's 2020 and gay footballers are still having to hide their true identities. Almost every other major industry has openly gay celebrities and influencers. Why is football (and sport in general) lagging so much behind?

My first thoughts were along the lines of players being afraid of their teammates' reactions. That they'd be afraid they might not be wanted in the locker room anymore because they shower together and so forth. Then I learned that [a number of gay players have come out to their teammates but not to the outside world](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/26/20-footballers-have-told-me-theyre-gay-says-top-football-boss/). Naturally, that is not to say that it doesn't play a role. The fear comes from a number of different factors and it differs between players. One huge factor is undoubtedly the reactions of us, the fans.

The problem of coming out was emphasized by an unnamed gay player of the Premier League [in an open letter](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/read-gay-premier-league-stars-22338520) earlier this year where he says: ""Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare. And it is affecting my mental health more and more. I feel trapped and my fear is that disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse"". Furthermore, he states that ""I just don’t think football is ready yet for a player to come out"". I recommend you read the full letter, and to the player behind it, whoever you are, thank you for speaking out.

I think it is time that we as fans show the stars we all know and love that their sexuality does not affect our opinion of them. We need to make them feel welcome. We need to show them that football is ready for players to be themselves.

Will every single fan be supportive? Unfortunately, no. However, I firmly believe that a large majority of fans will be supportive and drown out the voices of the few.

Understandably, it is very hard to be the first player to come out of the closet. However, as we have seen in the past, these things become easier for each person following the last. Hopefully, we will see the first openly gay Premier League player soon. And the second. And the third. Until suddenly we will be shaking our heads that this was ever a problem in the first place.

To all the gay footballers in the Premier League (or elsewhere), if you ever read this, I want to say the following:

&gt;I support you and welcome your sexuality. I don't want you to live your life hiding who you are. I don't want you to have to live your golden years in mental agony. I want you to feel safe, loved, and supported as the person you truly are, because you deserve it. I understand that you might not feel ready to come out and I respect that, but if you are, know that I am ready for you.

If football is ever going to be ready, we need to show both our current and future gay stars that we care. Many of our favorite activities might be closed due to the pandemic, but we can show our beloved players that football is **open** for gays. #FootballIsOpenForGays

1. Surely the best way to play is the way that wins you games instead of trying to play into the opponents’ hands.

2. Why do they feel like they know better than the best manager of the last 15 years

"What happened to that club? I'm a Chelsea fan, so there's obviously a part of me that enjoys their misery. That said, I'm pretty shocked at how the fortunes have reversed. 

I remember 5 years ago, Chelsea was a midtable club that was in danger of being relegated for a part of the season while Arsenal was playing attacking football with Alexis Sanchez, Ozil, and Giroud leading the charge. They also were doing good business by developing the young talent and then buying from the outside at great prices to fill in the gaps/keep the squad competitive. I think they also had managed all or most of their stadium debt, so it seemed like the future was bright. They had the combination of good youth players, world class talent (Sanchez/Ozil at that time), and a self-sustaining model.

Now, look at them. They've spent almost as much as Chelsea, but have made horrible transfer purchases (Pepe), haven't gotten any results from their stars after handing them fat contracts (Ozil and Aubameyang thus far), and don't seem to be producing any Jack Wilshere or Theo Walcott type of talents from their academy anymore.

What led to quick and sudden decline? After missing champions league once, it seems they completely fell off, despite a supposedly self-sustaining model. They are also now well behind their rivals and will likely be handicapped financially due to the pandemic and no Champions League football in the near future.","Seriously, What Happened to Arsenal?"

In the Arsenal vs Wolves match last week, Luiz came charging in for a header and collided with Jimenez in the box as he cleared the ball from a corner. I have heard a few people claiming Luiz came in recklessly however I think I agree with the majority here saying it’s a 50:50 ball with both players trying to help their team. Both players were grounded, with Luiz having a significant gash on the head which causes frequent bleeding during the match, and Jimenez actually being knocked unconscious as a result of the collision. It was reported Jimenez was out of it for around 10 minutes before regaining consciousness.

**Transcript:**

When you see 2 players collide like this, very similarly to the Bailly Maguire incident for United last year in the Fa Cup semi-final vs Chelsea, the 1st thing that comes to mind is potential concussions. The Fa and Premier League have been called out by pundits multiple times over the last few years particularly around this subject saying players do not have enough protection from these injuries and teams should be allowed to have temporary concussion substitutes. From a health standpoint I really like this recommendation because it removes the pressure on a manager to keep a player on in fear of using up an unnecessary sub and gives the injured player the most ample chance to recover and be assessed in that short amount of time.

Recently in the last few years the Fa introduced a concussion protocol for teams to follow depending on the league they are in. Regardless of who you play for, if a player (in this case Luiz and Jimenez) suffers a head injury the 1st thing you need to do as the healthcare professional is DR ABC (Danger, Response, Airways, Breathing and Cardiovascular) and assess for evidence of a concussion. A concussion is a term thrown around a lot in the media, but what does it actually mean in a medical context. A concussion ‘medically’ refers to a mild traumatic brain injury often caused by a bump or significant knock to the head which causes the brain to hit the inside of the skull. This can also occur when a person experiences whiplash.

When you have a player that has been involved in a head collision or injury, at first we are going to assess them and find out if they are showing any symptoms of concussion like dizziness &amp; headache. However in addition to asking them if they are experiencing any of these, something is to consider is players may not be telling the truth because they want to play particularly in situations where they are in the last year of their contract or fighting for a spot in the 1st team. So to control for this, we would ask a few questions testing for memory disturbance such as

1. What venue are you at today?
2. What half is it now?
3. Who scored last in the game?
4. Did you team win the last game?

Any incorrectly answered question may indicate that potentially a player is suffering from concussion however bear in mind someone with a brain injury may still be able to answer these correctly. In that very short time, the clinician has to make a decision whether they think a player has suffered a concussion or brain injury, which can be an extreme burden if a team is chasing a game and the star gets injured or big games are coming up. However, as the clinician you must isolate yourself from the surroundings and decide what is best for the player and only the player. If any potential signs of concussion arise, there is only 1 option. Take them to hospital for full and detailed health checks looking for possibility of brain injuries. Personally I have only been involved in 2 concussion checks live in a football match and both instances the player was ok and allowed to continue.

With David Luiz we can assume there were no signs of a concussion as he was able to play on by the Arsenal Medical team, however the big contention was surrounding why he was allowed to continue if blood was dripping down and if he was just not showing signs of injury. This is where the debate comes in, as the current rules say players who pass the concussion protocol test can continue to play and gashes as long as they can be controlled are minor occurrences as we have seen in Premier League history with many players wearing bandages around their heads during matches.

For regular concussion protocol players at the highest level of football with access to the best immediate treatment are scheduled to return after 1 week (6 days to be precise) and 12 days if 17-19. In grassroots football, this extends to 2-3 weeks depending on symptoms and if players are assessed as fit to return by healthcare staff at the respective clubs.

With Jimenez’s injury, things get more difficult because it has been reported he suffered a skull fracture as a result of the collision with Luiz. 2 Players I know off have suffered these injuries in the past, Petr Cech most famously who was able to return to play after a period out and become a Chelsea legend. Secondly. Ryan Mason who’s career was unfortunately ended as a result of the injury. From a medical standpoint, I am not too worried about the actual fracture as breaks in bones can always be fixed, reattached or connected using a metal plate (see full video for image of fixed skull). The more concerning matter at hand is the traumatic brain injury experienced however it will be interesting to see if Jimenez’s heading ability is affected by the injury or if his skull is more susceptible if something similar happens again.

“A skull fracture is one thing, the other more serious issues tend to be what’s going on with the underlying tissues,” says Dr Michael Grey, of the University of East Anglia. “Recovery wise, the fracture itself is less of an issue. The bones will repair themselves. They’ll start to fuse within two to three weeks, and it will be more or less solid again in six weeks.”

Yes the bones have to heal, but the real challenge I feel will be the making sure there are no neurological defects that may arise in the short term or potentially manifest itself later on in the future. **So, when will Jimenez return, based on all the information not a for a while is the best answer**. Even though its vague if we look at what Dr Grey said the skull alone with take around 6 weeks, but the time out is truly dependent on neurological symptoms. **If Jimenez shows any signs of degeneration neurologically this could end up very sadly for him with a potential career end but let’s all hope that doesn’t happen and he is able to return safe and healthy when the time is right**.

"**Yes I am a Chelsea fan but I truly believe the points I make are unbiased facts.** 

So I just think that Lampard is doing really well with Chelsea, has shown signs of being a great tactician, adaptable to situations, not just a one trick pony and can win things with Chelsea.   
Since he has come in I have heard comparisons to him and Arteta saying ""Arteta worked under Pep he will show up Frank"" and ""Frank took Derby from 6th to 6th and took Chelsea from 3rd to 4th""  


I don't think people understand that to take a team into a Championship play off final in your FIRST EVER year as a manager is not a bad achievement. Also taking charge of a Chelsea side having gotten a transfer ban, brought in tonnes of youth players, lost their best player (Hazard) while other teams signed and improved.   


I also think that although last season they dropped lots of points to games they should have won due to individual errors, they performed great, have a really attractive style, have a go at teams. We played Liverpool 4 times last year, and in all of them games we were arguably the better team (maybe not in the 5-3) and would have won had we been more clinical.   


This season since Mendy and Silva have been regularly starting we have conceded like 4 goals in all comps, only lost to Liverpool (with 10 men for the second half, kepa giving away a goal and missing a penalty) and we have dropped points to WBA (due to alonso) and Southampton (due to kepa).   


Yes people can say we have spent loads and it should be expected, but the foundations for the style of play already existed last season. So to recap, Lampard is a great manager and is levels ahead of Ole and Arteta.",Lampard not getting enough credit and putting an end to the Arteta comparison.

"Hey all, another dumb American trying to get advice on what team to support here!

Some background, I am a huge sports fan and sports card collector that is trying to expand my watching and collecting horizons. I have typically only paid attention to baseball and American Football, but I recently have found myself wanting to watch and collect other sports as well. I have always loved baseball the most since I have a team I am dedicated to (go Yankees!), so I was wanting to get that same experience as I begin to watch Premier League matches.

After doing some browsing the common consensus seems to be to watch some matches and see who stands out to me, but for some reason that seems a bit impersonal to me. I am a Yankees fan because my family used to live in New York for generations, and I want that more personal connection to the team I support. This brought me to the idea of using Ancestry to figure out where my English ancestors were from. After a bit of digging I discovered that my 9th great-grandfather was born in Manchester before coming to the colonies in the early 1700's.

That helped me decide that I wanted to support a team from Manchester, but I know absolutely nothing about the differences between Manchester City and Manchester United. I was hoping to get a bit of help breaking down the clubs, their history, their fans, etc. between those two clubs so I can make a bit of a more informed decision before I start watching the matches more regularly. I have read a few things about each club, but since I don't have much background on the history of the league I was hoping to get more info on how the the clubs are perceived by those of you here. If any of you are fans of American Football or baseball as well and can make comparisons to teams from those sports as well that would be very helpful.

"I am an Arsenal fan and I posted the below in the Arsenal community and got a mixed review, I would love to know what is the general consensus and if in your comments you could state the team you support, for reference.... 

  
For me personally, league-wide, VAR has to stay but has to be used in the correct way, think back to before VAR and how many goals were disallowed for offside when the player was onside, or how many goals were given even though the linesmen got it wrong and they were, in fact, offside or even fouls that when you watch the replay should be an absolute stonewall red card and sometimes aren't even given a yellow for.

Imagine the Auba goal against man utd last year when he was clearly about a yard onside and the linesman got it wrong, went to VAR, and got given.... but this season the officiating quality has just slowly declined and declined, no other league has these issues and officials from other countries constantly get selected over British referees for champions league finals and European and world cup goams, why? because the referees here stink, there needs to be a substantial investment into the training of referees in this country.

  
It's not even just about the offsides and drawing lines incorrectly and taking 3 minutes to come to a decision, there should be more reviews on shirt pulling the in the box for a corner as I'm seeing it weekly now across different games that defenders are pulling the back of the attacker's shirts and there's never a penalty for this...?

Also referees seem to be too reliant on it and hesitant to make instant decisions, especially with penalties.
Beside the obvious need to re-visit the rules, should VAR be used with a challenge system like in tennis where a team get 2 or 3 challenges per match, if you get it wrong you lose a challenge? Can this be used for penalties at least if not offsides as players can’t really judge offsides?
I believe this could restore a little bit of authority and accountability to referees and will not allow players to protest after every single incident.

"I may be an upset Villa fan, but I have channeled my frustration into this post and would like to make a point.

When VAR officials do their thing, they choose a still-frame of the moment when they deem the ball was passed. Analysis of that still frame is only appropriate when distances are scrutinised to the same precision, to which that still frame was chosen on.

**Some calculations:**

\- The impact or contact time between the passer's foot and the ball is ""approximately 0.01 s"" \[1\] and more precisely, around 7.5 ms \[2\].

\- A player making a run will most likely be sprinting at close to his peak velocity, which is approximately 9.2 m/s for a high-level, professional striker \[3\]. The highest measured sprint speed of a footballer was 10.6 m/s \[4\].

\- Thus, while the passer makes contact with the ball, the forward moves a distance of 0.069 m or around 7 cm (using values of 7.5 ms and 9.2 m/s for contact time and sprint speed respectively).

I certainly feel that sometimes, VAR officials aim to judge offside to distances equal to or smaller than 7 cm... Ollie Watkins' offside tonight was by far not the closest. This would be measuring offside to a precision greater than that of our measurement, the still frame.

**Some other points I want to make:**

\- An additional variable could be the last defender moving in the opposite direction at the same time, meaning the margin may well change by 2 \* 7 = 14 cm while the ball is being passed.

\- The time precision in selecting the still frame may well slightly exceed the ball impact time, as there is probably a slightly longer apparent impact time when not analysed close-up in slow motion.

\- At distances of a few centimetres, many other miniscule factors could come into play, such as the length of shirtsleeves...

TL;DR the point I want to make is that offside is being judged to a physically ridiculous and impossible precision. I am surprised (or not really...) the PL/FA/FIFA didn't pay somebody to do these calculations for them.

**Edit, to include: What should be done, how do we move forward**:

For consistency, I understand little can probably be changed this season. A simple solution for offside would be to use thicker lines and judge it to be ""on-side"" if the lines touch. 

I'm fundamentally pro-VAR, but I think it needs a complete revamp, or ""project restart"" next season. Scrap everything we have and start from scratch. Use case studies from the past seasons and other leagues to reimplement what worked and find solutions for what didn't work. Pool the knowledge and opinions of former players, referees and fan associations to rebuild a better VAR.

"I'm a West Ham fan and consider Tottenham, Chelsea and Millwall my team's main rivals. I've generally had a positive opinion of Arsenal and it's fans because: a) some of my extended family support them, b) the good football they played at the beginning of the millennium and c) Ian Wright was one of my earliest idols (that'll date me). I'm telling you this to give you a perspective of where this opinion is coming from.

I've noticed a steady decline of Arsenal since their peak when they had Henry, Bergkamp, Pires, Ljungberg, Campbell et al. (I mean everyone has) because:

1. **Wenger inherited an incredible back 5.** Wenger inherited a back 5 of Seaman, Dixon, Winterburn, Adams and Keown (with Bould able to interchange). All of them played for England (albeit Winterburn and Bould only played a few games). Even as those players have left, Sol Campbell, Lauren and Ashley Cole all got to play with them, learn from them and get integrated into a stable defence. Over time, it became clear that Wenger struggled to recruit and develop defensive players. I believe Arsenal still have a soft spine due to this even today. As a separate point: I think Wenger really planned on Ramsey and Wilshere having run that Arsenal midfield for a decade, which they may have if it hadn't have been for significant injuries at key points in their development.
2. **There's been a lack of investment into the club since Kroenke joined the club.** I've looked at the money spent before and after Kroenke buying the club and there definitely was a downturn in spending. Don't get me wrong, much of this previous spending was poorly done, but the change of ownership seems to be the catalyst. Some might say that the change of stadium was a reason for this, but nothing has changed even after that period.
3. **Scouting has been very questionable and with no real plan.** There have been some good players signed in recent years: Martinelli, Tierney, etc. There's also been a lot of horrendous signings: Mustafi (*£35m),* Perez (£17m), Kolasinac (£0m), Mavrpanos (£1.8m),  Mkhitaryan (swap deal), Lichtsteiner (£0m), Papastathopoulos (£14.4m), Torreira (£27m), Guendouzi (£8m) since 2016. Many of these players didn't seem to fit into the Arsenal team from day 1 of being signed. To add to that, Cedric Soares, David Luis and Willian are all clients of Kia Joorabchian. Soares played 5 times (mostly off the bench) in the season he was brought in on loan, despite a need for backup in the fullback positions. He wasn't Southampton's first choice the last few seasons towards the end of his time there, and were trying to shop him around.  Somehow, he was given a 4 year deal. David Luiz and Willian have been given lucrative deals despite their age. Willian was given a £200K 3 year contract having turned 32. David Luiz had his contract renewed having turned 33 and despite countless poor performances last season. That seems dodgy to me. Key scouts leaving due to Covid cutbacks hasn't helped.
4. **There was a huge power power vacuum when Wenger left.** It's well documented that Wenger did EVERYTHING towards the end of his time with Arsenal (recruitment, coaching, director of football etc). I think him leaving has left a giant power vacuum and changed the politics within the company. Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi leaving abruptly is a sign of that. It definitely wasn't helped by Ivan Gazidis, who seemed to do the bidding of Kroenke.

These points are big picture takes that I have. I think looking in the short - term, I believe that Mikel Arteta should be given more time. If you hire a manager with zero experience in a league with Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho, Brendan Rodgers and Carlo Ancelotti, it has to be because you believe he has the right philosophy and traits to be successful. He's needed to learn on the job during a condenced and unusual season. I think he needs at least one full season and to see if he progress is being made and in fact, I would give him until the end of NEXT season.

Without Auba's goals, Arsenal would've been in a similar position to where they are now at any time in the last few seasons. Now that they've dried up (and to be clear, I'm not having a go at Auba for that - he's been amazing for 2.5 seasons and I haven't seen anyone step up to support him during his poor form), it's exposed what many Arsenal fans have told me previous that they're a very poor team without his goals.

Just to be clear, I don't know whether Arteta is the real deal yet. I've seen some good signs, but I he's not been consistent. I think getting rid of him so quickly won't serve Arsenal and only throw more instability in addition to the above issues.",Arsenal from a (relatively) neutral point of view

"I feel like managers are told to perform and put on a show on the sidelines. The [Jose Mourinho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jj_0syFXo0) antics, all the crazy celebrations, etc - I feel like they're instructed to do those things.

A coach that doesn't celebrate a goal passionately or doesn't react angrily when something doesn't go his way might not be entertaining to watch so the business side of football dictates that he needs to do those things to satisfy the fans or else he isn't suitable to be managing.

The Premier League is a global brand that is a lot about image and impression. It needs entertaining, passionate and rowdy managers, not just those who are brilliant in tactics and could command a team.

I think this is the reason why Lampard, being a new coach, decided to try and establish his tough guy image (by beefing with other managers like Klopp). He knew the intense chemistry between SAF, Rafa, Arsene, Jose etc, needed to be replicated by his era, his own batch of Premier League managers.

"Wouldn't it be better if four linesmen in total were used instead of two linesmen? With two linesmen on both sides that can look directly across each other. If both make the same decision regarding a marginal offside, there's no need to go to VAR. If one flags for offside while the other doesn't, THEN go to VAR. This would mean VAR is used only for decisions that are NOT clear and obvious, which is what VAR was supposed to be for.

He's become a bit of a meme so far this season, and he definitely should be doing better, but a goal contribution every 129 minutes in all comps isn't bad for how ""poor"" he has been. For comparison, Mane is at every 122 minutes. And I'm sure I'll get arguments that Mane contributes when he doesn't score as well but Martial ties United's attack together, his contribution outside of goals is actually very underrated. Just look at their with/without record.

Not to mention, United as a team have been shocking how is he supposed to be consistent? Look at Aubameyang, there's no doubt he's world class, but even he can't do anything with Arsenal how they are.","Martial is getting ""not a 9"" shouts but last season he got 23 goals without taking penalties"

"I'm sorry but Arteta gets way too much excuses regarding him having a bad team and I think it's a load of bollocks. Arsenal's team is nowhere near as bad as Arteta's tactics is making them out to look. They have a ok defense. Tierney and Gabriel are very talented players. Along with Bellerin, Luiz and Leno and that is not a bad defense at all. Up front they've got players like Aubameyang, Pepe, Willian and Saka. Midfield is probably the weakest part of their team but you've still got Partey. I don't see why on earth Arsenal have to play this absolutely dross football that Arteta is forcing upon them. Is this team so bad that they can't muster an open play goal in 7 hours of football. Are they that bad that they can only win 1 out of their last 5 games.Let's be real. Arsenal has easily the 6th best team in the Premier League. They have a better team than Leicester, Wolves, Southampton, Aston Villa. And yet Arteta is having them play like a Championship side. And what has all that defensive football got them? 4 losses in the league and 10 goals conceded is hardly anything to write home about.

Lampard proved last season that you can get something out of a team even if the defense is very weak. I think last season Chelsea and Arsenal this season have about an equal level of talent. Yet compare how Arsenal are playing and how Chelsea played. Arteta has got it completely backwards. People gave him a lot of slack after he won the FA Cup. But the truth is an FA Cup doesn't prove that you are a good manager. A lot of times a inept manager can make a team look much worse than they actually are, in the same way that a good manager can make a team look better than they are. Last season Kovac said Bayern players cannot play high pressing football. He got sacked, a good manager came in named Hansi Flick and lo and behold Bayern suddenly becomes the best pressing team in the world. This is a textbook example of a bad manager who is making his team look worse than they are due to his incompetence and lack of trust in his players. It's no different with Arteta.",Arsenal having a bad team is a myth

Now here is where I have the issue. The game will be suspended and replayed at a later stage. Why ? This inconveniences Manchester United who are ready to play the game. Yet city have failed to keep a track of their players who are getting payed hundreds of thousand of pound just to follow the bloody rules.

Given how Cavani was fined £100,000 and banned for 3 games because he said one word that was deemed inappropriate, why is it that a group of players can break the UK and the biggest punishment they face is a fine that is likely what they earn in a week or even less.

"In the season so far, the off-side calls made by VAR have been the topic of many discussions because it has determined the outcome of many games. 
Adding to this, I have a question:
They spend a lot of effort (drawing perpendicular lines, zooming in, and looking at different camera angles) to see if a person is behind or in front of a defender, but it seems as though they don't spend the same amount of effort to determine WHEN the ball is kicked. When, exactly, is the balled considered as being kicked? 

I suppose it is the moment the ball leaves the kicker's foot? But shouldn't they spend the same amount of effort to find this exact moment and then freeze the frame and move to where the person is on-side or off-side? To me, this moment is just as important as the millimeters they look at at goalside.",VAR: The ball leaving the foot
"So I've spent most of this season so far looking at ways to quantify how much teams have improved/worsened since last season as a way of analysing performance.

For example, West Ham started this season with an incredibly difficult run of fixtures and that should have been reflected in any comparisons to performance from last season early on.

The algorithm for deciding the final number takes in a lot of different factors ranging from performance, outcome and result data points. I'm always updating it so the table is often being rebalanced but those changes are usually incredibly subtle and affect the final numbers by small amounts.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and for some discussion to be sparked by this. What makes Southampton come out so low for example?

"1. Liverpool: Become first back to backside to win the title since Man city did with 17/18 to 18/19 while doing without arguably their best player which is just incredible thinking about it 
2. Manchester United: Wins their first title since 2013 and Burno Fernandes shoots up to become a top 8 player on the planet and the best midfielder in the world while Rashford boost up to the top 30 and Ole gets in the top half of mangers in Europe by far and properly this would be their first title win that is totally unexpected from the start
3. Leicester City: It's been five years since their last title win in 2016 which is the greatest achievement in football history winning the premier league in the fashion that they did. but if they do it again then I feel like it would more impressive considering the fact that the quality of the league and the parity feels so much higher then a couple of years ago and Jamie Vardy legacy right now would be one of the most unique in football history considering winning two titles with two totally different styles with two totally different mangers and supporting casts as while his current ranking would shoot up to top 20 to top 15 in the world and a definite top ten striker in the world
4. Tottenham: This feel like a once in a lifetime opptumuinty to win a title in such a wide-open race as Harry Kane has been on another planet lately as Son has become his robin to his batman as he tries to break the assist record for most in premier league history and try to win a golden boot as well. if they win a title then Jose Mourihino's legacy just becomes that much better considering the rock bottom point that he had with Manchester United at the end of 2018. Harry Kane winning his first major trophy would make him a top 5 player in the world without a doubt and the conversation between Kane vs Lewy become a lot tighter than a lot of people think while Son becomes a top 15 player in the world. 
5. Manchester City: I'm not going to lie to you that this man city is a lot more pragmatic than another season by a pretty big margin because pep had to sure up the woeful defense of last year with a lot more rigid and old school approach which got them off to a very slow start which hit rock bottom this season with shocking 5-2 loss at home against Leicester City, but picked back up to this point where they had their best performances by far versus Chelsea which in the first half ripped them into shreds in under 40 mins scoring three goals which 6 or 7 honestly which tells me that they ready to sneak up on Liverpool or whoever at the top in the new few weeks and take their spot through the more defensive-minded approach which scores far fewer goals, but could potentially be the reason that they win their third title in 5 years which for pep will further cement his legacies as a top ten coach of all time period despite all of the money that he has spent and Kevin De Bryune will ended be remember as a premier league legend and the best midfielder of last 5-10 years. 

This season has been so many wild highs and lows that whatever I am saying right now could be null and void in a couple of weeks time and who knows whoever wins this title will be remembered for a very long time as properly one of if not the craziest title races of all time of all of football recent history by far and honestly as a Chelsea fan who properly out of races seeing current results lately go bad, I am just crazy ride ahead honestly",What does a Premier League title do for each of the top 5 teams for their legacies as a whole?
"1. In 2004, Porto was the only champion outside of the four major leagues in the new century. The stars in the array were Deco, Carvalho, and coach Mourinho.

2. In 2005, Liverpool, who was struggling in the Premier League very hard, had a mediocre lineup (I just left Irving, Torres did not come). The stars with a small median are Gerrard and Alonso who have not fully grown up.

3. In 2007, AC Milan, Sheva left, the main lineup is too old, and already has the prototype of Milan nursing home (Inzaghi, Maldini, Dida, Cafu, Gattuso, Seedorf are not young), but The opened Super Kaka saved the Milan pension team, head coach Ancelotti

4. In 2012, Chelsea, Mourinho's team's final peak and craziness, (Lampard, Terry, Drogba, Cech, Essien, the central axis is very old), Torres is in no state, the beginning of the season Boas messed up the Chelsea locker room even more.

Cheers!",This table is looking pretty awesome this season...
"A lot of people including me will say yes to this question. Henderson and Fabinho are playing as their CB's and they are missing the flair in the midfield. Who would they sign

SAMUEL GIGOT
Samuel Gigot is a French CB from Spartak Moscow who is 6'3"" and 27 years of age. Spartak are 3rd after 19 games (10/5/4) with 21 goals conceded which is 1.10 goals conceded per game. Gigot has also popped up with 3 goals in the Russian League and could be a half decent mid-term signing. Liverpool have also conceded 21 goals this season but in 2 less games which is 1.23 goals conceded per game. Based off stats, Gigot would be a great addition

JEROME BOATENG
Jerome Boateng is a signing that is much more money than  Samuel Gigot but is a much better player. The German may be in his Late 20's and Early 30's but is one of the most decorated footballers in the history of the game. 2 UCLs, 2 Super Cups, 2 Club World Cups, 8 Bundesligas, 5 German Cups and the World Cup, he's won everything in Germany but can he win anything in England?",Should Liverpool sign a new CB

Constant centre back injuries. City have had Aguero constantly injured as well as full back injuries. Spurs have had kane and son injuries. Yet Liverpool whinge non-stop.

Edit: Just want to add that Klopp basically played the same starting XI for 2 seasons running and avoided injuries. Every other team has some rotation (apart from Spurs). It's a wonder with all their running, how mane, Salah and Robertson haven't been injured more.",The nerve of Liverpool complaining about injuries

"**Arsenal: David Alaba**. This might be a bit unrealistic, but Alaba is most likely leaving Bayern. If Arsenal can beat Real and others to the player, he would massively improve Arsenal in the form of a center back and being great cover in defensive midfield and at left back, with Tierney and Ceballos both massively underperforming this season, although Tierney has had a few decent games recently. Another option might be Maximillian Arnold, a great midfielder with the capabilities to execute Arteta's vision

**Aston Villa: Jack Harrison**. I hate this fact because I'm a Leeds fan, but a front line consisting of Harrison, Watkins, and Grealish would be arguably the best front 3 outside of the big 6. Harrison is a quality playmaker who can bring what Ross Barkley doesn't bring, and therefore push Aston Villa to do better.

**Brighton: Joao Moutinho**. Brighton right now are a team that, under the right leadership, could actually surprise a few people. A decent defense, decent attack, but a midfield which could use a lot of reinforcement. It's not like Potter doesn't have them playing good football, for example Tariq Lamptey's goal against Spurs (which should not have stood), but Adam Lallana isn't the best creative base for a team gunning for mid table security. Moutinho might not have age on his side, but he's definitely a player that can improve Brighton. A little work on patching up the defense would be useful as well, although that's more a tactical problem than a technical one.

**Burnley: Eddie Howe**. For an actual suggestion though, **Josh King** would add some much needed pace and tooth into a very poor attacking team. Still won't change anything if Dyche tries to make Dwight McNeil dribble the ball from his penalty area to the midfield line then boot it forwards to the attack, but Burnley fans can pray,

**Chelsea: Raphaël Guerreiro**. In my post a few days ago, I preached the importance of not signing big name players who only are that big because they scored 2 penalties and a tap-in to bring their team to the UCL quarter finals before a ""tragic"" 6-1 aggregate loss to Bayern where the player didn't even touch the ball once. Guerreiro actually has talent, something rare in a signing worth over 10m in the EPL. He's proven his abilities at Dortmund, and with Chillwell flopping, he's an escape route. Right now, I'm not sure he's the best signing. Try out Chillwell, and if not him then Marcos Alonso. But if Chillwell is a certifiable flop, Guerreiro is a talent proven by years of hard work at a big club.

**Crystal Palace: Divock Origi**. Any striker worth more than 5m would be a lifesaver for this club. Wilfried Zaha and Eze are being drowned by the lack of playmakers and strikers around them, or at least quality ones. Luka Milojevic works decently in the midfield, Guaita at the back, but you need 2 strikers to run a 4-4-2 system, and I'm only seeing one. Origi isn't the worst striker, although definitely overhyped by Liverpool fans, so why not him? Other options are Salomon Rondon, Arkadiusz Milik, and Jamie Tartt (don't look him up the show will probably make any proper englishman want to die but everybody else finds it nice).

**Everton: Christian Eriksen**. He's played terribly at Inter. He has absolutely no justification playing at a good team again. But Everton do need a decent deep lying playmaker to complement James, DCL, and Richarlison (amongst others). Eriksen is a definite outside option for it. He would definitely be a great player for Ancelotti to have and experiment with, and can change Everton for the better if he returns to his Spurs form.

**Fulham: Pablo Fornals**. Outside option, definitely. But if Fulham can get him, he would inject the midfield with some quality. Lookman isn't the best in the world at penalties, Mitrovic hasn't been clinical, but the midfield is arguably the absolute worst in the Premier League. Fornals would be a realistic, cheap option who could actually help them.

**Leeds United: Igor Zubeldia**. I didn't want to be unoriginal and just say Puig, so I went with Zubeldia.  He's not necessarily a replacement for Phillips or a center back, more as a player who can play anywhere in that region to compensate for the insane amount of injuries they've been picking up.

**Leicester City: Troy Parrot**. Spurs will be reluctant to let him up, but there's no question that Vardy's getting older. That isn't to say Vardy is no longer Premier League quality: I would still call him top 10 strikers in the league if not top 5. However, it isn't wise to rest your hopes on a 33 year old. My suggestion is to sign Parrot and maybe another more proven striker and develop them while Vardy can still work as their first choice to have a good backup in good time.

**Liverpool: Dayot Upamecano**. Good center back to cover for the injuries. If not a purchase then a loan with option to buy. Pretty simple.

**Man City: Kingsley Coman**. Goals needed. Goalscorer of UCL winning goal and treble winner. Outside shot, could become excellent under Pep. If he doesn't instantly take to the EPL though expect many ""flop"" messages.

**Man United: James Justin**. The easy choice for this would be a Pogba replacement. However, I personally think Donny van de Beek is the best option to replace him. James Justin is an outside shot for the left back position, which definitely needs reinforcement with Luke Shaw being the only/best option there. Brandon Williams is nothing compared to Justin, who's had a decent season at Leicester.

**Newcastle United: Ben White**. If Ashley actually opens his wallet for the first time in millenia (barring last summer), Ben White could reinforce the back line at Newcastle to push them even further from the relegation zone. Could cost them upwards of 30m, so a cheaper option may be needed

**Sheffield United: Juan Mata**. This would be a desperate signing without a doubt, but it might actually work. If Wilder can stomach changing to a new system and allowing Mata to be their main playmaker, it might not leave them last. Not saying they would survive, but Mata is a realistic signing who could provide some temporary relief or at the very least a win.

**Southampton: Sergio Romero**. Not to say that Southampton's goalkeepers are not EPL quality, but to be up at the top they need a stronger goalie. Romero doesn't instantly come to mind, but the stats back him to be the best backup goalie in practically the world.

**Spurs: Julian Weigl**. He is the perfect Mourinho player. He can work in the midfield or at the back, young but old enough to be in his prime, and would be perfect cover at Spurs for Alderweireld and Hojberg. 

**West Brom: Olivier Giroud**. Unlikely. But West Brom need a good striker desperately and Lampard's delusions about Tammy at striker and Werner at the wing means it could actually be done. Goals are needed and he can provide them.

**West Ham: John Brooks**. Not particularly great, but a good center back to keep West Ham from conceding goals, which would be much appreciated considering their lack of effective center backs.

**Wolves: Thilo Kehrer**. Seeing Kilman at CB is great considering my widespread condemnation of it (youth talents getting efficient game time) not happening enough, but it also means it's the easiest spot for me to improve so I'm going to be a hypocrite just this once and any other time I see fit. Thilo Kehrer has flown under the radar of impressive young talents, not seeming out of place at one of the biggest teams in Europe. Kilman could definitely still develop and maybe even compete with Kehrer, but either way an improvement would be made.

I’m amazed at how Kane can turn into a playmaker instantly but other times be such a prolific goalscorer. Heung-Min Son has scored a lot of goals too this season thanks to Kane. I still  can’t wrap my head around the fact that the pair have linked up 13 times in half a season, and the striker has gotten more of the assists.

"Just saw some post on this subreddit saying ""Why isnt Pep Guardiola getting any criticsm?"". Maybe because its not his fault?

Or is it the simple fact that your attack just forgot how to finish? Pep Guardiola isnt a puppet master. Hes not the one whos supposed to be scoring into an open net from 2 yards out (Im looking at you Raheem). And its not just that, you actually have City fans who want Pep out. Have they forgot all hes done for them? 100 point season, back to back prems, and fourmidables? 

You also got Mikel Arteta, he came in and instantly transformed Arsenals playstyle. They went on to beat some of the best teams and won 1 and a half trophy (yes, im talking about the community shield. cant count that as a full trophy). He started the season quite shit, but does form not exist for managers? Aubameyang has scored like 1 goal all season and you dont see Arsenal fans saying he should fuck off. Artetas doing good now as well. This was a problem with Unai Emery as well. He almost got them a top 4 finish, had that unbeaten run for a fair amount of time for Arsenal, took them to a Europa League final then the fans turned on him and he lost all his confidence.

He also has the best H2H record amongst the two managers(vs Ole: 2 meetings WW.  vs Lampard: 4 meetings LDWW). Also for some extra icing, Arteta has a better win record against Klopp than anyone listed(4 meetings WWLW). That's pretty good for someone who only managed a team for 10 months(that's when Arteta last met Klopp) in his managerial career.

I don’t think I would mind VAR if it actually resulted in these calls being ruled out, but I feel VAR with its constant replaying and zooming of minimal frames if anything gives more free kicks and penalties for any theatrics like this.

"I mean, I believe he is a decent player, but seriously... He literally only played 134 ( +/- a couple) fricking minutes in the premier league, and have 0 assist and 0 goal. He didnt proved anything about his talent in this league.",Can someone explain how The Telegraph ranked Thiago Alcantara as the 10th best PL player in the year 2020?
"For example, Werner. He scored 28 goals last season in a system built for him. You could see a large amount of his goals coming from his breakaway abilities. Meanwhile, Lampard has him playing as a left winger half the time. He doesn't have the same effect, even if he has the attributes for it. Havertz is being talked about being a flop as well, even though he's been injured half the time and not performed all too poorly in general. This has been happening for a while, with Morata and Keita and so many others at other teams. Just because you have one good season doesn't mean you have the best passing range in Europe. Just because you work well in one system in one league doesn't mean the same is true for another system in another league. People should stop complaining when a player isn't instantly the best at their team when they were hyping up their potential instead of their abilities. This has happened time and time again. 

Instead of signing your Havertzs and Werners and Moratas who have just had a great season under a different system, instead consider signing somebody like Mendy who has a proven track record outside of media attention. Somebody like Luuk de Jong could probably score 10+ EPL goals a season but he's not talked about because he hasn't played for a ""big team"" yet even though he has a Europa League title under his belt. Julian Weigl could probably act as a midfield pivot for any team outside of the biggest few, but he's not talked about because he didn't ""reach his potential"" at Dortmund. Wout Weghorst hasn't been talked about at all in footballing circles even though he's led his team by scoring 9 in 13 in the Bundesliga, and is now starting to see some transfer rumors to Spurs. Let me predict what his career will be like if he makes this move: He'll join them, be unable to break through the Kane-Son dynamic, be called a ""flop"" because he scored once in the 5 games he was provided since Troy Parrot received more attention than him, build his career back at the age of 30 in a different league or at a lower level team like Crystal Palace, and eventually will be known as ""that guy who flopped at Spurs"" even though his career was so much bigger than that. This has been my Ted Talk/Rant, thank you for listening","Stop hyping players up and then feeling let down when they ""flop"""

Spurs: 3.83 (none)

Chelsea: 4 (2 PL Titles, 1 EL Title, 1 FA cup, 1 League Cup)

Why are they able to get away with it? Is that the only way to get a foul call in the Prem now? Is it on the refs? Is it on the players for being soft and going to ground way too easily?

Alli can do a job as a second striker. They had no choice but to defend for 90 minutes because the attack was so poor. If that was Dele Alli playing like that he'd have come off in the first half.

As soon as Ndombele went off they had no chance. He's the only one that could hold up a ball up there. What was the point of not playing him at all against Leicester when they actually needed him, for him to only play 60 minutes again tonight?

"Who’ve been your signings of the season for PL clubs? In no particular order, mine go...

Gabriel (Arsenal) - Currently looks like Arsenal’s only competent defender, you’d shudder to imagine  where they’d be without him. 

Watkins (Villa) - Really great all around striker, strong, fast and a great finisher on the ground or in the air. Spearheads Villa’s attack better than Wesley or Samatta and looks a menace whenever he’s on the pitch. 

Torres (City) - Really young, great fee and looks like becoming a star already under Guardiola. 

Martinez (Villa) - Villa’s unsung hero this season and maybe the most consistent shot-stopper in the league behind Alisson, Martinez makes you wonder why Chelsea didn’t go for him over Mendy. 

Allan (Everton) - The perfect anchor to a midfield containing more attacking options and one of the best DMs in Europe for almost 5 years, all for less than €30m. Only nitpick is his age, but for such a low fee he still makes it in. 

Lookman (Fulham) - Has looked absolutely electric for Fulham this season. Seemed underwhelming as a loan deal, but at this rate Fulham and every club in England should be vying to get him out of Leipzig this Summer. Huge key pass and dribble numbers and bear in mind that he’s still only 23. 

Fofana (Leicester) - Huge fee but for a 19-year old I don’t think anyone could have expected him to slot straight in to a top-4 challenging defense. Really astute signing shows that Leicester have still got it when looking for incredibly talented youth. 

Jota (Liverpool) - 12 goals and 2 assists in under 1200 league/UCL/cup minutes. Liverpool are lucky they didn’t go for Ismaila Sarr instead. 

Thiago (Liverpool) - Not had much of a chance to show it yet, but the best midfielder in the world for €30m is an unreal bargain. 

Hojbjerg (Spurs) - Exactly what Spurs needed in the midfield. Hojbjerg adds some steel to a midfield commonly criticized for being soft, as well as a great range of passing and an assured touch when in possession. When you consider that the deal basically works out to €3m + Kyle Walker-Peters, it’s a slam dunk. 

Coufal (West Ham) - The second acquisition from Slavia Prague in as many windows, Coufal’s strength and defensive mettle makes you wonder what other bargains are there to be had outside of Europe’s top 5 leagues.

Thiago Silva (Chelsea) - Added in by popular demand and due to the fact I completely overlooked him, Silva has provided maturity and stability to a young Chelsea side for the low cost of his wages.",Signings of the Season

"I include realistically because while we would all love to sign Van Dijk Neuer Lewandowski Ronaldo and Ramos, that might be a bit of a stretch 😅

As a city fan, after watching most of our games this season, especially the last couple, it seems straightforward enough. We need someone who can finish chances with 100% consistency. Sterling Torres Mahrez Bernardo are all phenomenal players but in their instinct, as wingers who often assist, they can’t be called upon to finish chances as much as we need. As a result we throw away anywhere from 1-3 scoreable chances a game.

Nothing would make me happier than him succeeding as manager and Chelsea winning the league with him. However, as a lifelong Chelsea fan I will always put the success of my club first. Multiple players mentioned that they chose to come to Chelsea due to Frank Lampard being here (Werner, Havertz and even Haaland said something along those lines). I believe he did a great job last year making it to the FA Cup Final (we should have won that) and finishing in the Top 4 with a transfer ban. We spent 250+ million this summer on absolutely brilliant players (Werner = 2 most goal contributions in Bundesliga, Havertz = one of the most highly touted young players in the world, Ziyech = someone who should have come to the Prem long ago, Chilwell = a top left back in the Prem, Mendy = stop gap goalkeeper and Silva = aging but still top level CB). We came into this season knowing that the plan was to close the gap on Liverpool and Man City this season and have top 4 and trophy as a BARE MINIMUM. We started this season with Kepa in goal and struggled even though we were playing teams that should not cause us problems (outside of Liverpool of course). Me and other fans made excuses about Kepa's mistakes and injuries against West Brom, Southampton and Liverpool. We went on a 17 game unbeaten streak while performing well in Europe and everyone was gassed up and claiming we were realistic title challengers and potentially UCL winners. Meanwhile nobody realized that none of the teams we beat were in the top 10 of the league. Then we had a shocker against Everton and Wolves, which in my opinion exposed the weakness of Lampard's tactics. We consistently play Timo on the wing (he's not a fucking winger and sucks there.. it's plain for everyone to see), we haven't played Kai in the correct position all season (he's a 10) and we INSIST on crossing the ball when we play Tammy up top (who can't win a header for his life.. look at the Spurs, Krasnodar, Arsenal games). Lampard's substitutions also make absolutely no sense, we didn't bring on Giroud when he's not only on form but also all we're doing is crossing for example (34 crosses, he also had Timo, Tammy and Giroud all on the field at the same time in one game). He also played a 50% Reece James and Ben Chilwell who were injured when we have a proven albeit aging RB in Azpi (our club captain btw) and Emerson who played absolutely fine against West Ham. He brought on Jorginho who doesn't progress the ball and played poor against West Ham as well. We are 15 points behind where we were at this point last season as well. I could say much more if anyone else is curious but this is a novel at this point.",Lampard Out (except there are no top managers really available anymore): And this is why...

The title says it all really. Some of the decisions that VAR have made have been to microscopic. You want VAR to catch the mistakes that linesmen miss but what is the point of it if the calls being made are in the millimeters. IMO if the kind of measurement being made by VAR are so miniscule as to barely affect the reaction time of the players in any way then it shouldn't called. A tolerance limit should be set wherein if a player is off by a certain distance then he should be allowed the benefit of the doubt.,VAR should have a tolerance limit.

"Now, I know what you are thinking - just pick the best 18, right? Well, not necessarily. I can choose a heavily attacking side with Sterling, Mahrez, Salah, Rashford, Mane, Bruno, Son and Kane, but is this team realistically outscoring the opponent for 38 games? No, there needs to be some strategy into choosing the best all-around team. Plus, for the sake of it being more interesting, you gotta think about non-quantifiable factors like - who will be the big start, who will be pulling the strings in the midfield, are you gonna pick very offensive wing backs and if yes - maybe a CDM extra to cover the spaces behind them?   


Rules for participating:

* **Max 3 players per team -** the idea is not to pick Liverpool's team and add De Bryune and Maguire (haha)
* **Pick the formation you want -** 3-4-3, 4-4-2, anything you would like to play 
* **It's based on players right now, not their potential -** picking a team of the Lampteys, Curtis Joneses and Pedro Netos of the world would be fun but realistically they are not breaking the record 

No more rules - let's play! 

**Starting 11:**

1. **GK - Alisson -** Alisson wins us 15 points by himself, just making those 1 or 2 sensational saves per game that keep us in a game/save us a tight game. Very easy choice. 
2. **RB - Kyle Walker -** provides defensive stability, can play as the right CB in a back three and on offence can still produce, albeit not as much as Trent Alexander Arnold. Walker is the man for the right.
3. **CB - Conor Coady -** I will never not say that he is one of the best CBs in the league. In a back 4 they could be sensational.
4. **CB - Virgil Van Dijk -** I mean, when he's playing he is the best CB in the world. Remember, people were saying he was better than Messi. That's insane for a defender.
5. **LB - Ben Chilwell -** this season for Chelsea he was even better than last year, capable on the back and as dangerous as ever on the front.
6. **CDM - N'Golo Kante -** having infront of these 4 basically locks my defence. It's unplayable - Kante's there and then if you pass by him you face a wall. These defence alone is getting 27 to 30 clean sheets. 
7. **CM - Paul Pogba -** not only Kante locks the defence, but he unlocks Pogba. Example? Look no further than World Cup 2018 where Pogba and Kante played together and we all saw what happened. 
8. **CM - Kevin De Bryune -** basically have De Bryune be the more offensive midfielder out of the three.
9. **RW - Mohamed Salah -** for me Salah is the second best player in the Premier League and the best right wing in the world. Look at his numbers - since joining Liverpool probably only Messi and Lewa have more goals than him. 
10. **LW - Heung-Min Son -** what can I say - he is different. With these passers he gets three, four chances per game and with his ratio of goals/shots, that guarantees goals.
11. **ST - Jamie Vardy -** I know Harry Kane plays in the PL, but again, with this passing Vardy will get so many chances. He is also way better in a possession play than people think.

**Reserves:**

1. **Nick Pope -** so underrated. Nick Pope filling in for Alisson sounds like a dream.
2. **Thiago Silva -** the idea of Silva being on the bench is that he is quite old so I don't want him to play every game. Rotate the starting two, start every other game. When he plays he is always dominant. 
3. **Reece James -** perfect choice from the bench to give Walker some air. 
4. **Jack Grealish -** someone parked the bus against us, it's 75th minute and it's 0-0, what do we do? Easy, put Grealish in and he will find the gap in the opponent's defence.
5. **Raheem Sterling -** Son terrorized the opponent's right back in the first half, he is tired and has a yellow. And now he will defend against a well-rested Sterling for 45 minutes! Yikes.
6. **Harry Kane -** this bench is making me feel anxious for the other side. Kane from the bench? What?
7. **Wilfried Ndidi -** Kante will cover a lot for the attacking players and he needs to have a player coming off the bench to cover for him.

With this my side is finished. In a normal game you have De Bryune and Pogba pushing balls forward to the three speedsters and if the opponent parks the bus, you can put Grealish in to empty pockets, Sterling to make them uncomfortable and Harry Kane to annihilate.

"I'll be honest, I now try to avoid anything on twitter specifically, but also media response to Leeds matches as a whole. While it's nice to watch the praise for wins, some of the opinions and views of pundits, fans of other teams and even Leeds fans, just hurt my head. So I wanted to put my honest views on everything Leeds related, just to see what other Leeds fans think, if anyone agrees/disagrees, but also what other fans of other teams think.

To start with, in all honesty the expectation from the media for Leeds this season took me by surprise. Sure, we play exciting football, and having watched it for over 2 years it's become normal though I'm reminded watching other team's games how good the football is (don't get me wrong, losing is still losing and not a great feeling, but as for the quality of football and excitement when I watch, it's great), but that doesn't mean we'll be a team challenging for Europe like I saw at the start of the season.From all honest Leeds fans (because we all have those crazy fans), our aim is, and always has been the same as any promoted from Championship. Survival. I'm not in a dream world as to the relaity of what we should expect to achieve as a team. I would take a goal difference survival, a couple points survival, hell, even a goal line technology malfunction survival (Just a joke Villa fans, nothing serious). After 16 years out of the Prem, where it was looking more and more likely we'd be forever a Championship team, with the odd upset in playoffs/scare of relegation to League 1, I want nothing more than to just stay in the Premier League.

As for the love Bielsa gets, it's all based on his footballing impact, not accolades and trophies. He has a clear style of play, and he implements it at every club he goes to, win, lose or spanking (As we saw on Sunday). I think a lot of that admiration from people for him gets mixed for expecting him to be making Leeds a team challenging the top 6 (Or so it feels). People aren't followers of him or lovers of him because he wins trophies and tactically outclasses managers left right and centre, but for the exciting and clear style no matter the opponent, and how he is football mad in every way. He's an intriguing manager, which a strange personality and a pure passion for football as a game. Manchester United's starting 11 cost around £400m, and Leeds's cost around £70m. You'd never expect to win that game with any manager, so it's no surprise we lost. I wouldn't choose to lose heavy but it will happen with how we play, Bielsa's coaching and play style doesn't work miracles to overturn teams with starting lineups over 5x the price of ours (although some would argue our promotion seemed like a miracle for the majority of Leeds fans). But it does allow us to see our team actually compete with these teams and look like we can score just as easily as anyone, despite the clear weakness in our squad. That is what I admire.

&amp;#x200B;

Our performances in the league this season haven't been much different to teams in previous years who've stayed up, so I'm understandably happy with how we've played, even with some of the losses we've taken. We're doing well in relation to our avoid relegation target, and that is what I find important. But there's plenty of football to play, and many points to be won/lost, so I'm not naive to the possibility of relegation, anything can happen, but as things stand we're on track.

For me personally, I use watching Leeds now more than ever as an escape from the real world, from the upset of being in a tier 4 area over Christmas, and stresses of working in a critical worker sector right through all the lockdowns. This year has been hard for everyone, each of us with our own struggles and battles, but I'm glad football can continue, and I'm even happier knowing I can watch us play like we do. I don't think we're 'better' than any team because of it, morally or tactically. I just enjoy the viewing pleasure of how the players have bought into the exciting playstyle, and I'll make the most of it even if it results in relegation. I am and always be a Leeds fan, and regardless of the outcome of the season, I'll always appreciate that Bielsa has sparked my interest in Leeds to its maximum I've experienced (As a 20yr old fan whose only ever remembered/experienced doom and gloom), and given us hope that we can get back to being a 'big' team some day, even if that is many many years down the line.

First and foremost, the full stadium wrap with not just the first tier of seats being wrapped, but the whole stadium. That added with a majority of the stadium being filled with pictures of fans that cannot make the game, gives a personal and fan friendly customisation that no other club really gives. And then with the HATRED (with the HAT crossed out to just spell red) along with other ""United against racism"" wraps that coordinates with the fight against racism campaign is a touch of class.

"Glad the concussion sub rule is coming in, fine with staying at 3 subs, but it got me thinking about other things that could be changed.

I’d like to see diving be penalised retroactively. I know in the NBA the referees review every decision (or non-decision) after the game, so if the same is done with football matches it should be pretty easy to identify dives (successful or otherwise). I think if you start handing out 1-match suspensions, players will be much less likely to dive.

I’d also like to see the 6-second rule actually be applied. This is in part to quell time wasting late on, but also just to speed up the play. Keepers take 10-15 seconds almost every time, more when they’re winning late on and go to ground after making a straightforward catch...I’d kinda like to see the how actually adhering to the rule affects play.

Finally, another one that’s already a rule but not implemented, I’d like to see bookings (and thus stopping players from doing it) when they stop a quick fee kick or throw. Like players commit a foul then grab the ball, or they just stand in front of the ball and stuff. I dunno, I’d like to see the game run more smoothly.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kgx0yq)",Which team has the best squad in the league. Me and my friends have not been able to agree for hours.
"Sheffield United started off the season with 4 straight losses before they drew Fulham for their first point of the season. They then lost 8 straight games before drawing Brighton today.

It's a long shot, but it would be funny if Sheffield United goes on a 12-game losing streak before earning their next point.

This squad is truly miserable. As evidenced by today, even the points they earn are depressing to watch.","If the pattern continues, we'll need to wait for 12 more Sheffield United losses before they earn their next point(s)"
"The key indicator is to see whether the ability of most players is uplifted or suppressed.

I think Arnold is a typical player promoted by the team system. This is difficult to verify. Because he has been in Liverpool. However, for the national team, he is not the main player, and he has not had any good performances.

What is a team? It can help you make up for your weaknesses. His strengths and weaknesses are very obvious, his strengths are bold offense and imaginative passing. The downside is that his defense is really bad. Many people can sieve him if he doesn't help him. Moreover, his bold pass itself is a risk for the team to change the ball. He has a lot of assists, but also missed a lot of passes, at least a lot more than Robertson.

Liverpool did it, using a group of hard-powered players as the cornerstone, and then the team role allows functional players to maximize their strengths and avoid weaknesses.",The only teams in the Premier League that have truly become a team are Liverpool and Manchester City?

"I know the way Leeds are playing is (very) entertaining, but when they are playing poor (defense/passing/set-pieces/poor aim), the commentators are so focused on Leeds (mostly positive feed), that the opposition team is forgotten or not getting enough credit.

"Hate to be all like ""oh wah wah wah VAR is ruining football"" but what an absolute joke. Man gets the ball and accidentally stands on someone's foot. 

Let's go through reasons why people should be sent off.

1) Serious intent - there was quite obviously 0 intent there, he went for the ball (AND GOT IT, might I add)

2) A horribly late challenge - as I said, he got the ball, you can't just not follow through, that's a part of how moving works

3) A horribly dangerous challenge - He literally stood on the guy's foot. After getting the ball. It's an utter 50/50, they both went for the ball. The guy who got the ball got sent off.

"In my honest opinion I think it's such a close call, it really should benefit the attacker therefor onside. The check was very quick, they saw it was close and let it go, brilliant in that sense. But, this has not been done before and it's clearly inconsistent with the nanometer-checks we've seen earlier where checking the offside takes well over 3 minutes.

I honestly hope they continue to check like they did with this one. But if they now go back to zooming, drawing and checking toe nails for offside like before, it will show just another sign of inconsistent VAR  usage.

If you shut down Son and Kane, it does not mean that you are safe. Everyone in Tottenham knows what is required of him, but at the same time, everyone can score. Well, Kane and Son Heung-min understand each other so well that they may not interact at all during the match, and then “turn on” and make a result. “***

 After what his agent said last week about him needing to leave, then Pogba pledging his commitment,and now again his agent saying it would not be in the transfer window.

In the video, you can clearly hear the sound of players colliding. Even as a Villa fan I thought there wasn't much contact at the time. I can completely imagine the ref using his ears as well as his eyes to make the decision. In this instance, it wasn't overturned.

However, there have been other penalty decisions overturned. Since lockdown, teams have mostly been playing in empty stadiums, where you can hear more of the action.

I wonder if referees are using their ears more to make decisions. Then, when reviewing the slowed-down footage (either at Stockley Park or pitchside), they no longer use that audio. From different angles, contact between two players can look better or worse.

My theory is that in some cases, referees see what looks like contact, and their ears confirm it for them. However, on review, and without audio, that's overturned.

If that is the case (and someone with access to stats could check it), then a lo-fi option would be to keep the audio during reviews (if they don't already). Sports like cricket use snick-o-meters to determine how much contact was made between bat and ball.

As crowds return the pitchside mics may pick up less, but keeping the audio could be a useful signal to officials trying to decide whether, and how much contact was made, especially when it's unclear from different camera angles.",Does lack of audio during reviews impact VAR decisions?

"The term sleepwalking towards disaster is well and truly applicable too Arsenal, from the days of consistently finishing 4th and gloating about it too now being an outright shambles, every step Arsenal have taken as a club has led them to this moment. From transfer strategy too management, everything is wrong structurally, and frankly with or without Mikel Arteta I think results wouldn’t be different. 

This is a problem that I believe could last up to a decade or beyond. I saw it with Liverpool (who probably started from a worse position in terms of squad and management before arriving too the brendan Rodgers and now loool era’s) and we can see it now with United where issues have remained permanently since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. 

The worst part is the Arsenal fans. Who have now reared there true ugly heads (IMO). They are completely spineless, this is just based on the differing reactions from Liverpool and United fans when there clubs had/have fallen into turmoil. One win gets blown out of proportion, and a loss is the end of there club. These run of results should act as a humbling, yes Arsenal are a “big club”, but I see no acceptance of the current situation. When Emery was in it was about getting rid of him to find a style and give an opportunity to the younger players, that was the Arteta plan. Now it’s again get rid of the manager, find a style and give a chance to the younger players. 

Xhaka has never been good enough, nor has elneny, mustafi or holding and get they consistently find themeselves with opportunities in the first team. Every player can play well for a short period of time but it’s inevitable that the flaws which hinder them from being truly elite players will rear themselves, which is perfectly fine, however Arsenal fans seem to disillusion themselves by a few good performances and then expect the good performance to become permanent.

"I know players looking for fouls is nothing new but this season it seems like it's happening constantly. Will be watching a game and it'll constantly be broken up by someone collapsing to the floor screaming cos they got poked and will win a foul or the ball will be kicked out to see if they're ok, even though they are completely fine and there was never enough enough contact for that.

I feel like players know especially with VAR that any contact no matter how minimal will result in a foul as long as they fall over, e.g. the Robertson foul on welbeck. Players have also stopped competing for aerial battles cos they know if the other player jumps they can get a foul by falling over and saying they jumped into them, Joe Roden did that like 3 or 4 times in the match against Chelsea. Idk if I'm just noticing it more but it definitely feels more common and its making games really shit to watch and there's no exciting physical battles.

"The top 6 matches in the PL are always hyped up for a  week and a lot of the time when it comes to the match it just turns into an absolute snore fest.

I mean you have Man Utd vs Chelsea and Chelsea vs Spurs which finished 0-0, you had Man Utd vs Arsenal which was 0-1 (but only from a penalty) and as I’m writing this it’s currently 0-0 in the Manchester derby with two big chances after 37 minutes.

At the moment all the top 6 teams are so scared of slipping up in one of the big matches and so they don’t do anything risky and the end result is just a boring match that usually finishes 0-0 with most of the possession in midfield and hardly any attacking play.

In all honesty the only ‘exciting’ top 6 game was Spurs (6) vs Man Utd (1) and even that was boring in the way that it was so one-sided.

The big PL matches now are the main reason why I find the mid table and low table PL matches and then championship matches so much more exciting.",Top 6 matches are so boring now

"Full disclosure: I’m a Liverpool fan but I want some insight. More often than not, this sub has had mostly meaningful discussion which is why I’m posting here. 

While United and Liverpool are rivals, I like watching United do well. Especially, in the Ferguson days, I felt like United could dig really deep for a result even when their players were having an off day - it kind of reminds of how Liverpool plays now. 

Ole is a strange one. Whenever I see him on the touch line or interviews, it seems as though he’s not in control of the team.  I’m finding it difficult to put it into words but it just seems different from his Cardiff days when it felt like he was in charge. When United are having an off day, I’ve not seen Ole really take charge. For a lack of a better word, Ole seems a little clueless. I’ve noticed this even when the team is playing well. 

I really like United players - I think Rashford and Bruno are going to be world beaters and Pogba needs to find some form. Do you United fans feel like your players are lacking some inspiration or a more authoritative manager?

"Last season they were being tipped as outsiders for UCL at one point. Now they'll need a miracle to escape relegation. 11 games so far this season, only a singular point picked up. What has gone wrong?

An interesting point to start on is Sheffield's wage bill: Only Leeds United come close in how little is spent on player wages. They're currently around the $20m USD mark, upgrading $4-5m since last season. For reference, Mesut Özil's salary is about the same as the entire Sheffield United team. Phil Jagielka is their best paid player.

Tactically, Sheffield play a 5-at-the-back, with a formidable center 3 being key to their good results last season. However, this time around, injuries have hit hard. Jack O'Connell's statistics show how well Sheffield perform with and without him: Sheffield win 475% more games with him, get 3 times more points per game, and concede half the amount of goals. Attempts to move around players to fix this haven't worked: they lack physicality, awareness, and pure quality. It's easy to see just how hard this has affected Sheffield as a whole.

Up front as well, Lys Mousset's lack of performances has left Sheffield stranded. And no offense to everybody in Sheffield's attack, but they need to improve heavily if they want to survive this season. In winter, a striker needs to be signed who can finish goals. If Sheffield's defense can partially recover themselves, and the attack can be improved to get Sheffield playing at last season's level, perhaps they won't see themselves facing Championship teams next season",What's gone wrong at Sheffield United this season?

Lastly, what do you think is the biggest contributor to Arsenal performing so poorly?

I feel a managers duties are to put out the best side each and every performance while also maintaining so rest for players in big stretches. I also think they are there to motivate players and challenge them to grow in aspects of their game that need development. However, a manager can only do so much and as much as they want their to perform the best, they cant actually control how the team goes out and plays. I see a lot of Arsenal fans who want to blame Arteta for Arsenals performances and my question is just why do you think he's to blame? Is he not putting out the best lineup? Again, I feel its a bit harsh to throw all criticism at a manager because the players are the ones actually out their on the pitch and he cant control the fact that someone like Aubameyang hasn't scored a game time goal in however many matches its been.

"As another year soon comes to a close we see yet another year without the first openly gay Premier League player. This is not a problem most of us think about on a daily basis, but we really should.

Can you imagine? It's 2020 and gay footballers are still having to hide their true identities. Almost every other major industry has openly gay celebrities and influencers. Why is football (and sport in general) lagging so much behind?

My first thoughts were along the lines of players being afraid of their teammates' reactions. That they'd be afraid they might not be wanted in the locker room anymore because they shower together and so forth. Then I learned that [a number of gay players have come out to their teammates but not to the outside world](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/26/20-footballers-have-told-me-theyre-gay-says-top-football-boss/). Naturally, that is not to say that it doesn't play a role. The fear comes from a number of different factors and it differs between players. One huge factor is undoubtedly the reactions of us, the fans.

The problem of coming out was emphasized by an unnamed gay player of the Premier League [in an open letter](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/read-gay-premier-league-stars-22338520) earlier this year where he says: ""Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare. And it is affecting my mental health more and more. I feel trapped and my fear is that disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse"". Furthermore, he states that ""I just don’t think football is ready yet for a player to come out"". I recommend you read the full letter, and to the player behind it, whoever you are, thank you for speaking out.

I think it is time that we as fans show the stars we all know and love that their sexuality does not affect our opinion of them. We need to make them feel welcome. We need to show them that football is ready for players to be themselves.

Will every single fan be supportive? Unfortunately, no. However, I firmly believe that a large majority of fans will be supportive and drown out the voices of the few.

Understandably, it is very hard to be the first player to come out of the closet. However, as we have seen in the past, these things become easier for each person following the last. Hopefully, we will see the first openly gay Premier League player soon. And the second. And the third. Until suddenly we will be shaking our heads that this was ever a problem in the first place.

To all the gay footballers in the Premier League (or elsewhere), if you ever read this, I want to say the following:

&gt;I support you and welcome your sexuality. I don't want you to live your life hiding who you are. I don't want you to have to live your golden years in mental agony. I want you to feel safe, loved, and supported as the person you truly are, because you deserve it. I understand that you might not feel ready to come out and I respect that, but if you are, know that I am ready for you.

If football is ever going to be ready, we need to show both our current and future gay stars that we care. Many of our favorite activities might be closed due to the pandemic, but we can show our beloved players that football is **open** for gays. #FootballIsOpenForGays

1. Surely the best way to play is the way that wins you games instead of trying to play into the opponents’ hands.

2. Why do they feel like they know better than the best manager of the last 15 years

3. Spurs players haven’t won a trophy and if a man comes in that has won everything in his career and tells you that you can win by doing it this way, surely you won’t have a problem with following his instructions. 

4. Spurs have scored 4,5 and even 6 past teams this season, so is that not attractive football?

5. Same point really, but counter attacking football is more “attractive” for me than a goal with a 40 pass build up.

Maybe it's just Ole actually is lost (I trust, I believe), maybe its because of the passion, maybe it's fitness.

"What happened to that club? I'm a Chelsea fan, so there's obviously a part of me that enjoys their misery. That said, I'm pretty shocked at how the fortunes have reversed. 

I remember 5 years ago, Chelsea was a midtable club that was in danger of being relegated for a part of the season while Arsenal was playing attacking football with Alexis Sanchez, Ozil, and Giroud leading the charge. They also were doing good business by developing the young talent and then buying from the outside at great prices to fill in the gaps/keep the squad competitive. I think they also had managed all or most of their stadium debt, so it seemed like the future was bright. They had the combination of good youth players, world class talent (Sanchez/Ozil at that time), and a self-sustaining model.

Now, look at them. They've spent almost as much as Chelsea, but have made horrible transfer purchases (Pepe), haven't gotten any results from their stars after handing them fat contracts (Ozil and Aubameyang thus far), and don't seem to be producing any Jack Wilshere or Theo Walcott type of talents from their academy anymore.

What led to quick and sudden decline? After missing champions league once, it seems they completely fell off, despite a supposedly self-sustaining model. They are also now well behind their rivals and will likely be handicapped financially due to the pandemic and no Champions League football in the near future.","Seriously, What Happened to Arsenal?"

"Hi Everyone,

In the Arsenal vs Wolves match last week, Luiz came charging in for a header and collided with Jimenez in the box as he cleared the ball from a corner. I have heard a few people claiming Luiz came in recklessly however I think I agree with the majority here saying it’s a 50:50 ball with both players trying to help their team. Both players were grounded, with Luiz having a significant gash on the head which causes frequent bleeding during the match, and Jimenez actually being knocked unconscious as a result of the collision. It was reported Jimenez was out of it for around 10 minutes before regaining consciousness.

**Transcript:**

When you see 2 players collide like this, very similarly to the Bailly Maguire incident for United last year in the Fa Cup semi-final vs Chelsea, the 1st thing that comes to mind is potential concussions. The Fa and Premier League have been called out by pundits multiple times over the last few years particularly around this subject saying players do not have enough protection from these injuries and teams should be allowed to have temporary concussion substitutes. From a health standpoint I really like this recommendation because it removes the pressure on a manager to keep a player on in fear of using up an unnecessary sub and gives the injured player the most ample chance to recover and be assessed in that short amount of time.

Recently in the last few years the Fa introduced a concussion protocol for teams to follow depending on the league they are in. Regardless of who you play for, if a player (in this case Luiz and Jimenez) suffers a head injury the 1st thing you need to do as the healthcare professional is DR ABC (Danger, Response, Airways, Breathing and Cardiovascular) and assess for evidence of a concussion. A concussion is a term thrown around a lot in the media, but what does it actually mean in a medical context. A concussion ‘medically’ refers to a mild traumatic brain injury often caused by a bump or significant knock to the head which causes the brain to hit the inside of the skull. This can also occur when a person experiences whiplash.

When you have a player that has been involved in a head collision or injury, at first we are going to assess them and find out if they are showing any symptoms of concussion like dizziness &amp; headache. However in addition to asking them if they are experiencing any of these, something is to consider is players may not be telling the truth because they want to play particularly in situations where they are in the last year of their contract or fighting for a spot in the 1st team. So to control for this, we would ask a few questions testing for memory disturbance such as

1. What venue are you at today?
2. What half is it now?
3. Who scored last in the game?
4. Did you team win the last game?

Any incorrectly answered question may indicate that potentially a player is suffering from concussion however bear in mind someone with a brain injury may still be able to answer these correctly. In that very short time, the clinician has to make a decision whether they think a player has suffered a concussion or brain injury, which can be an extreme burden if a team is chasing a game and the star gets injured or big games are coming up. However, as the clinician you must isolate yourself from the surroundings and decide what is best for the player and only the player. If any potential signs of concussion arise, there is only 1 option. Take them to hospital for full and detailed health checks looking for possibility of brain injuries. Personally I have only been involved in 2 concussion checks live in a football match and both instances the player was ok and allowed to continue.

With David Luiz we can assume there were no signs of a concussion as he was able to play on by the Arsenal Medical team, however the big contention was surrounding why he was allowed to continue if blood was dripping down and if he was just not showing signs of injury. This is where the debate comes in, as the current rules say players who pass the concussion protocol test can continue to play and gashes as long as they can be controlled are minor occurrences as we have seen in Premier League history with many players wearing bandages around their heads during matches.

For regular concussion protocol players at the highest level of football with access to the best immediate treatment are scheduled to return after 1 week (6 days to be precise) and 12 days if 17-19. In grassroots football, this extends to 2-3 weeks depending on symptoms and if players are assessed as fit to return by healthcare staff at the respective clubs.

With Jimenez’s injury, things get more difficult because it has been reported he suffered a skull fracture as a result of the collision with Luiz. 2 Players I know off have suffered these injuries in the past, Petr Cech most famously who was able to return to play after a period out and become a Chelsea legend. Secondly. Ryan Mason who’s career was unfortunately ended as a result of the injury. From a medical standpoint, I am not too worried about the actual fracture as breaks in bones can always be fixed, reattached or connected using a metal plate (see full video for image of fixed skull). The more concerning matter at hand is the traumatic brain injury experienced however it will be interesting to see if Jimenez’s heading ability is affected by the injury or if his skull is more susceptible if something similar happens again.

“A skull fracture is one thing, the other more serious issues tend to be what’s going on with the underlying tissues,” says Dr Michael Grey, of the University of East Anglia. “Recovery wise, the fracture itself is less of an issue. The bones will repair themselves. They’ll start to fuse within two to three weeks, and it will be more or less solid again in six weeks.”

Yes the bones have to heal, but the real challenge I feel will be the making sure there are no neurological defects that may arise in the short term or potentially manifest itself later on in the future. **So, when will Jimenez return, based on all the information not a for a while is the best answer**. Even though its vague if we look at what Dr Grey said the skull alone with take around 6 weeks, but the time out is truly dependent on neurological symptoms. **If Jimenez shows any signs of degeneration neurologically this could end up very sadly for him with a potential career end but let’s all hope that doesn’t happen and he is able to return safe and healthy when the time is right**.

"**Yes I am a Chelsea fan but I truly believe the points I make are unbiased facts.** 

So I just think that Lampard is doing really well with Chelsea, has shown signs of being a great tactician, adaptable to situations, not just a one trick pony and can win things with Chelsea.   
Since he has come in I have heard comparisons to him and Arteta saying ""Arteta worked under Pep he will show up Frank"" and ""Frank took Derby from 6th to 6th and took Chelsea from 3rd to 4th""  


I don't think people understand that to take a team into a Championship play off final in your FIRST EVER year as a manager is not a bad achievement. Also taking charge of a Chelsea side having gotten a transfer ban, brought in tonnes of youth players, lost their best player (Hazard) while other teams signed and improved.   


I also think that although last season they dropped lots of points to games they should have won due to individual errors, they performed great, have a really attractive style, have a go at teams. We played Liverpool 4 times last year, and in all of them games we were arguably the better team (maybe not in the 5-3) and would have won had we been more clinical.   


This season since Mendy and Silva have been regularly starting we have conceded like 4 goals in all comps, only lost to Liverpool (with 10 men for the second half, kepa giving away a goal and missing a penalty) and we have dropped points to WBA (due to alonso) and Southampton (due to kepa).   


Yes people can say we have spent loads and it should be expected, but the foundations for the style of play already existed last season. So to recap, Lampard is a great manager and is levels ahead of Ole and Arteta.",Lampard not getting enough credit and putting an end to the Arteta comparison.

"Hey all, another dumb American trying to get advice on what team to support here!

Some background, I am a huge sports fan and sports card collector that is trying to expand my watching and collecting horizons. I have typically only paid attention to baseball and American Football, but I recently have found myself wanting to watch and collect other sports as well. I have always loved baseball the most since I have a team I am dedicated to (go Yankees!), so I was wanting to get that same experience as I begin to watch Premier League matches.

After doing some browsing the common consensus seems to be to watch some matches and see who stands out to me, but for some reason that seems a bit impersonal to me. I am a Yankees fan because my family used to live in New York for generations, and I want that more personal connection to the team I support. This brought me to the idea of using Ancestry to figure out where my English ancestors were from. After a bit of digging I discovered that my 9th great-grandfather was born in Manchester before coming to the colonies in the early 1700's.

That helped me decide that I wanted to support a team from Manchester, but I know absolutely nothing about the differences between Manchester City and Manchester United. I was hoping to get a bit of help breaking down the clubs, their history, their fans, etc. between those two clubs so I can make a bit of a more informed decision before I start watching the matches more regularly. I have read a few things about each club, but since I don't have much background on the history of the league I was hoping to get more info on how the the clubs are perceived by those of you here. If any of you are fans of American Football or baseball as well and can make comparisons to teams from those sports as well that would be very helpful.

"I am an Arsenal fan and I posted the below in the Arsenal community and got a mixed review, I would love to know what is the general consensus and if in your comments you could state the team you support, for reference.... 

  
For me personally, league-wide, VAR has to stay but has to be used in the correct way, think back to before VAR and how many goals were disallowed for offside when the player was onside, or how many goals were given even though the linesmen got it wrong and they were, in fact, offside or even fouls that when you watch the replay should be an absolute stonewall red card and sometimes aren't even given a yellow for.

Imagine the Auba goal against man utd last year when he was clearly about a yard onside and the linesman got it wrong, went to VAR, and got given.... but this season the officiating quality has just slowly declined and declined, no other league has these issues and officials from other countries constantly get selected over British referees for champions league finals and European and world cup goams, why? because the referees here stink, there needs to be a substantial investment into the training of referees in this country.

  
It's not even just about the offsides and drawing lines incorrectly and taking 3 minutes to come to a decision, there should be more reviews on shirt pulling the in the box for a corner as I'm seeing it weekly now across different games that defenders are pulling the back of the attacker's shirts and there's never a penalty for this...?

Beside the obvious need to re-visit the rules, should VAR be used with a challenge system like in tennis where a team get 2 or 3 challenges per match, if you get it wrong you lose a challenge? Can this be used for penalties at least if not offsides as players can’t really judge offsides?

"I may be an upset Villa fan, but I have channeled my frustration into this post and would like to make a point.

When VAR officials do their thing, they choose a still-frame of the moment when they deem the ball was passed. Analysis of that still frame is only appropriate when distances are scrutinised to the same precision, to which that still frame was chosen on.

**Some calculations:**

\- The impact or contact time between the passer's foot and the ball is ""approximately 0.01 s"" \[1\] and more precisely, around 7.5 ms \[2\].

\- A player making a run will most likely be sprinting at close to his peak velocity, which is approximately 9.2 m/s for a high-level, professional striker \[3\]. The highest measured sprint speed of a footballer was 10.6 m/s \[4\].

\- Thus, while the passer makes contact with the ball, the forward moves a distance of 0.069 m or around 7 cm (using values of 7.5 ms and 9.2 m/s for contact time and sprint speed respectively).

I certainly feel that sometimes, VAR officials aim to judge offside to distances equal to or smaller than 7 cm... Ollie Watkins' offside tonight was by far not the closest. This would be measuring offside to a precision greater than that of our measurement, the still frame.

**Some other points I want to make:**

\- An additional variable could be the last defender moving in the opposite direction at the same time, meaning the margin may well change by 2 \* 7 = 14 cm while the ball is being passed.

\- The time precision in selecting the still frame may well slightly exceed the ball impact time, as there is probably a slightly longer apparent impact time when not analysed close-up in slow motion.

\- At distances of a few centimetres, many other miniscule factors could come into play, such as the length of shirtsleeves...

TL;DR the point I want to make is that offside is being judged to a physically ridiculous and impossible precision. I am surprised (or not really...) the PL/FA/FIFA didn't pay somebody to do these calculations for them.

**Edit, to include: What should be done, how do we move forward**:

For consistency, I understand little can probably be changed this season. A simple solution for offside would be to use thicker lines and judge it to be ""on-side"" if the lines touch. 

I'm fundamentally pro-VAR, but I think it needs a complete revamp, or ""project restart"" next season. Scrap everything we have and start from scratch. Use case studies from the past seasons and other leagues to reimplement what worked and find solutions for what didn't work. Pool the knowledge and opinions of former players, referees and fan associations to rebuild a better VAR.

"I'm a West Ham fan and consider Tottenham, Chelsea and Millwall my team's main rivals. I've generally had a positive opinion of Arsenal and it's fans because: a) some of my extended family support them, b) the good football they played at the beginning of the millennium and c) Ian Wright was one of my earliest idols (that'll date me). I'm telling you this to give you a perspective of where this opinion is coming from.

I've noticed a steady decline of Arsenal since their peak when they had Henry, Bergkamp, Pires, Ljungberg, Campbell et al. (I mean everyone has) because:

1. **Wenger inherited an incredible back 5.** Wenger inherited a back 5 of Seaman, Dixon, Winterburn, Adams and Keown (with Bould able to interchange). All of them played for England (albeit Winterburn and Bould only played a few games). Even as those players have left, Sol Campbell, Lauren and Ashley Cole all got to play with them, learn from them and get integrated into a stable defence. Over time, it became clear that Wenger struggled to recruit and develop defensive players. I believe Arsenal still have a soft spine due to this even today. As a separate point: I think Wenger really planned on Ramsey and Wilshere having run that Arsenal midfield for a decade, which they may have if it hadn't have been for significant injuries at key points in their development.
2. **There's been a lack of investment into the club since Kroenke joined the club.** I've looked at the money spent before and after Kroenke buying the club and there definitely was a downturn in spending. Don't get me wrong, much of this previous spending was poorly done, but the change of ownership seems to be the catalyst. Some might say that the change of stadium was a reason for this, but nothing has changed even after that period.
3. **Scouting has been very questionable and with no real plan.** There have been some good players signed in recent years: Martinelli, Tierney, etc. There's also been a lot of horrendous signings: Mustafi (*£35m),* Perez (£17m), Kolasinac (£0m), Mavrpanos (£1.8m),  Mkhitaryan (swap deal), Lichtsteiner (£0m), Papastathopoulos (£14.4m), Torreira (£27m), Guendouzi (£8m) since 2016. Many of these players didn't seem to fit into the Arsenal team from day 1 of being signed. To add to that, Cedric Soares, David Luis and Willian are all clients of Kia Joorabchian. Soares played 5 times (mostly off the bench) in the season he was brought in on loan, despite a need for backup in the fullback positions. He wasn't Southampton's first choice the last few seasons towards the end of his time there, and were trying to shop him around.  Somehow, he was given a 4 year deal. David Luiz and Willian have been given lucrative deals despite their age. Willian was given a £200K 3 year contract having turned 32. David Luiz had his contract renewed having turned 33 and despite countless poor performances last season. That seems dodgy to me. Key scouts leaving due to Covid cutbacks hasn't helped.
4. **There was a huge power power vacuum when Wenger left.** It's well documented that Wenger did EVERYTHING towards the end of his time with Arsenal (recruitment, coaching, director of football etc). I think him leaving has left a giant power vacuum and changed the politics within the company. Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi leaving abruptly is a sign of that. It definitely wasn't helped by Ivan Gazidis, who seemed to do the bidding of Kroenke.

These points are big picture takes that I have. I think looking in the short - term, I believe that Mikel Arteta should be given more time. If you hire a manager with zero experience in a league with Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho, Brendan Rodgers and Carlo Ancelotti, it has to be because you believe he has the right philosophy and traits to be successful. He's needed to learn on the job during a condenced and unusual season. I think he needs at least one full season and to see if he progress is being made and in fact, I would give him until the end of NEXT season.

Without Auba's goals, Arsenal would've been in a similar position to where they are now at any time in the last few seasons. Now that they've dried up (and to be clear, I'm not having a go at Auba for that - he's been amazing for 2.5 seasons and I haven't seen anyone step up to support him during his poor form), it's exposed what many Arsenal fans have told me previous that they're a very poor team without his goals.

Just to be clear, I don't know whether Arteta is the real deal yet. I've seen some good signs, but I he's not been consistent. I think getting rid of him so quickly won't serve Arsenal and only throw more instability in addition to the above issues.",Arsenal from a (relatively) neutral point of view

A coach that doesn't celebrate a goal passionately or doesn't react angrily when something doesn't go his way might not be entertaining to watch so the business side of football dictates that he needs to do those things to satisfy the fans or else he isn't suitable to be managing.

The Premier League is a global brand that is a lot about image and impression. It needs entertaining, passionate and rowdy managers, not just those who are brilliant in tactics and could command a team.

I think this is the reason why Lampard, being a new coach, decided to try and establish his tough guy image (by beefing with other managers like Klopp). He knew the intense chemistry between SAF, Rafa, Arsene, Jose etc, needed to be replicated by his era, his own batch of Premier League managers.

"I'm sorry but Arteta gets way too much excuses regarding him having a bad team and I think it's a load of bollocks. Arsenal's team is nowhere near as bad as Arteta's tactics is making them out to look. They have a ok defense. Tierney and Gabriel are very talented players. Along with Bellerin, Luiz and Leno and that is not a bad defense at all. Up front they've got players like Aubameyang, Pepe, Willian and Saka. Midfield is probably the weakest part of their team but you've still got Partey. I don't see why on earth Arsenal have to play this absolutely dross football that Arteta is forcing upon them. Is this team so bad that they can't muster an open play goal in 7 hours of football. Are they that bad that they can only win 1 out of their last 5 games.Let's be real. Arsenal has easily the 6th best team in the Premier League. They have a better team than Leicester, Wolves, Southampton, Aston Villa. And yet Arteta is having them play like a Championship side. And what has all that defensive football got them? 4 losses in the league and 10 goals conceded is hardly anything to write home about.

Lampard proved last season that you can get something out of a team even if the defense is very weak. I think last season Chelsea and Arsenal this season have about an equal level of talent. Yet compare how Arsenal are playing and how Chelsea played. Arteta has got it completely backwards. People gave him a lot of slack after he won the FA Cup. But the truth is an FA Cup doesn't prove that you are a good manager. A lot of times a inept manager can make a team look much worse than they actually are, in the same way that a good manager can make a team look better than they are. Last season Kovac said Bayern players cannot play high pressing football. He got sacked, a good manager came in named Hansi Flick and lo and behold Bayern suddenly becomes the best pressing team in the world. This is a textbook example of a bad manager who is making his team look worse than they are due to his incompetence and lack of trust in his players. It's no different with Arteta.",Arsenal having a bad team is a myth

1. He wasnt that good for team chemistry and was always getting mad at the ref, kept trying to do everything himself and just took shots out wide from half way
2. Said he makes 5000 pounds a week and thats peanuts compared to what he wants to make

is that a legit salary for u23 lower prem league team players?

"and if so, when is it going  away?

I've been following the Premier League since summer 2007 and I can't count how many times I've read in English papers or club forums or even on reddit of how players new to the Premier League are judged so damn quickly. THat if you scored 100 league goals in 4 seasons in SPain or won 3 league titles in Serie A, none of it matters if you don't hit the ground running.

"So I’m hearing that Scott Carson has tested positive for covid. Which leaves Man City short on GK for the game today against Man United. 

My problem I have with this is down to the fact that certain city players have breached the UK laws around covid and as a result contracted the disease and allegedly now infected other team players ans also the coaching staff. 

Now here is where I have the issue. The game will be suspended and replayed at a later stage. Why ? This inconveniences Manchester United who are ready to play the game. Yet city have failed to keep a track of their players who are getting payed hundreds of thousand of pound just to follow the bloody rules. Where the rest of the country are struggling to put food on the table and now have to stay locked down in the homes. Not mansions with acres of land to run around in. The premier league are also putting in millions to ensure everyone is tested regularly and to ensure that football can keep playing to the rest of us normal folk can have a little enjoyment of having the football on while we are stuck inside. 

A fine is not good enough. If players cannot take responsibility then they should be punished with a ban and the club has either to forfeit the game or field a weakened side. It has to black and white otherwise these players will continue to disrupt the game snd act they are invincible.

Given how Cavani was fined £100,000 and banned for 3 games because he said one word that was deemed inappropriate, why is it that a group of players can break the UK and the biggest punishment they face is a fine that is likely what they earn in a week or even less.

Surely a 3, 5 or even 10 match ban would be suitable for breaking COVID rules otherwise loads of players will continue to do it and potentially stop the pl because they could be spreading COVID to all teams.

-I completely forgot about Walker and obviously the same principle should be applied to him.

-I thought that it was bad on behalf of the FA before the match for letting Reguillon with no punishment (aside from one issued by Spurs) and I made this post after he assisted a goal because I saw the irony in this.

"In the season so far, the off-side calls made by VAR have been the topic of many discussions because it has determined the outcome of many games. 
Adding to this, I have a question:
They spend a lot of effort (drawing perpendicular lines, zooming in, and looking at different camera angles) to see if a person is behind or in front of a defender, but it seems as though they don't spend the same amount of effort to determine WHEN the ball is kicked. When, exactly, is the balled considered as being kicked? 

I suppose it is the moment the ball leaves the kicker's foot? But shouldn't they spend the same amount of effort to find this exact moment and then freeze the frame and move to where the person is on-side or off-side? To me, this moment is just as important as the millimeters they look at at goalside.",VAR: The ball leaving the foot
"So I've spent most of this season so far looking at ways to quantify how much teams have improved/worsened since last season as a way of analysing performance. I had gotten very tired with the general approach of saying ""x team had this many points at this stage last season!"" because that doesn't factor in any way, the order that the fixtures have come in. For example, West Ham started this season with an incredibly difficult run of fixtures and that should have been reflected in any comparisons to performance from last season early on.

Anyhow, this is what I've arrived at thus far.

The algorithm for deciding the final number takes in a lot of different factors ranging from performance, outcome and result data points. I'm always updating it so the table is often being rebalanced but those changes are usually incredibly subtle and affect the final numbers by small amounts.

"1. Liverpool: Become first back to backside to win the title since Man city did with 17/18 to 18/19 while doing without arguably their best player which is just incredible thinking about it 
2. Manchester United: Wins their first title since 2013 and Burno Fernandes shoots up to become a top 8 player on the planet and the best midfielder in the world while Rashford boost up to the top 30 and Ole gets in the top half of mangers in Europe by far and properly this would be their first title win that is totally unexpected from the start
3. Leicester City: It's been five years since their last title win in 2016 which is the greatest achievement in football history winning the premier league in the fashion that they did. but if they do it again then I feel like it would more impressive considering the fact that the quality of the league and the parity feels so much higher then a couple of years ago and Jamie Vardy legacy right now would be one of the most unique in football history considering winning two titles with two totally different styles with two totally different mangers and supporting casts as while his current ranking would shoot up to top 20 to top 15 in the world and a definite top ten striker in the world
4. Tottenham: This feel like a once in a lifetime opptumuinty to win a title in such a wide-open race as Harry Kane has been on another planet lately as Son has become his robin to his batman as he tries to break the assist record for most in premier league history and try to win a golden boot as well. if they win a title then Jose Mourihino's legacy just becomes that much better considering the rock bottom point that he had with Manchester United at the end of 2018. Harry Kane winning his first major trophy would make him a top 5 player in the world without a doubt and the conversation between Kane vs Lewy become a lot tighter than a lot of people think while Son becomes a top 15 player in the world. 
5. Manchester City: I'm not going to lie to you that this man city is a lot more pragmatic than another season by a pretty big margin because pep had to sure up the woeful defense of last year with a lot more rigid and old school approach which got them off to a very slow start which hit rock bottom this season with shocking 5-2 loss at home against Leicester City, but picked back up to this point where they had their best performances by far versus Chelsea which in the first half ripped them into shreds in under 40 mins scoring three goals which 6 or 7 honestly which tells me that they ready to sneak up on Liverpool or whoever at the top in the new few weeks and take their spot through the more defensive-minded approach which scores far fewer goals, but could potentially be the reason that they win their third title in 5 years which for pep will further cement his legacies as a top ten coach of all time period despite all of the money that he has spent and Kevin De Bryune will ended be remember as a premier league legend and the best midfielder of last 5-10 years. 

This season has been so many wild highs and lows that whatever I am saying right now could be null and void in a couple of weeks time and who knows whoever wins this title will be remembered for a very long time as properly one of if not the craziest title races of all time of all of football recent history by far and honestly as a Chelsea fan who properly out of races seeing current results lately go bad, I am just crazy ride ahead honestly",What does a Premier League title do for each of the top 5 teams for their legacies as a whole?

Their injuries haven’t been as severe as Liverpool and they are struggling even worst. They have been underperforming for almost 2 years straight.

"**Arsenal: David Alaba**. This might be a bit unrealistic, but Alaba is most likely leaving Bayern. If Arsenal can beat Real and others to the player, he would massively improve Arsenal in the form of a center back and being great cover in defensive midfield and at left back, with Tierney and Ceballos both massively underperforming this season, although Tierney has had a few decent games recently. Another option might be Maximillian Arnold, a great midfielder with the capabilities to execute Arteta's vision

**Aston Villa: Jack Harrison**. I hate this fact because I'm a Leeds fan, but a front line consisting of Harrison, Watkins, and Grealish would be arguably the best front 3 outside of the big 6. Harrison is a quality playmaker who can bring what Ross Barkley doesn't bring, and therefore push Aston Villa to do better.

**Brighton: Joao Moutinho**. Brighton right now are a team that, under the right leadership, could actually surprise a few people. A decent defense, decent attack, but a midfield which could use a lot of reinforcement. It's not like Potter doesn't have them playing good football, for example Tariq Lamptey's goal against Spurs (which should not have stood), but Adam Lallana isn't the best creative base for a team gunning for mid table security. Moutinho might not have age on his side, but he's definitely a player that can improve Brighton. A little work on patching up the defense would be useful as well, although that's more a tactical problem than a technical one.

**Burnley: Eddie Howe**. For an actual suggestion though, **Josh King** would add some much needed pace and tooth into a very poor attacking team. Still won't change anything if Dyche tries to make Dwight McNeil dribble the ball from his penalty area to the midfield line then boot it forwards to the attack, but Burnley fans can pray,

**Chelsea: Raphaël Guerreiro**. In my post a few days ago, I preached the importance of not signing big name players who only are that big because they scored 2 penalties and a tap-in to bring their team to the UCL quarter finals before a ""tragic"" 6-1 aggregate loss to Bayern where the player didn't even touch the ball once. Guerreiro actually has talent, something rare in a signing worth over 10m in the EPL. He's proven his abilities at Dortmund, and with Chillwell flopping, he's an escape route. Right now, I'm not sure he's the best signing. Try out Chillwell, and if not him then Marcos Alonso. But if Chillwell is a certifiable flop, Guerreiro is a talent proven by years of hard work at a big club.

**Crystal Palace: Divock Origi**. Any striker worth more than 5m would be a lifesaver for this club. Wilfried Zaha and Eze are being drowned by the lack of playmakers and strikers around them, or at least quality ones. Luka Milojevic works decently in the midfield, Guaita at the back, but you need 2 strikers to run a 4-4-2 system, and I'm only seeing one. Origi isn't the worst striker, although definitely overhyped by Liverpool fans, so why not him? Other options are Salomon Rondon, Arkadiusz Milik, and Jamie Tartt (don't look him up the show will probably make any proper englishman want to die but everybody else finds it nice).

**Everton: Christian Eriksen**. He's played terribly at Inter. He has absolutely no justification playing at a good team again. But Everton do need a decent deep lying playmaker to complement James, DCL, and Richarlison (amongst others). Eriksen is a definite outside option for it. He would definitely be a great player for Ancelotti to have and experiment with, and can change Everton for the better if he returns to his Spurs form.

**Fulham: Pablo Fornals**. Outside option, definitely. But if Fulham can get him, he would inject the midfield with some quality. Lookman isn't the best in the world at penalties, Mitrovic hasn't been clinical, but the midfield is arguably the absolute worst in the Premier League. Fornals would be a realistic, cheap option who could actually help them.

**Leeds United: Igor Zubeldia**. I didn't want to be unoriginal and just say Puig, so I went with Zubeldia.  He's not necessarily a replacement for Phillips or a center back, more as a player who can play anywhere in that region to compensate for the insane amount of injuries they've been picking up.

**Leicester City: Troy Parrot**. Spurs will be reluctant to let him up, but there's no question that Vardy's getting older. That isn't to say Vardy is no longer Premier League quality: I would still call him top 10 strikers in the league if not top 5. However, it isn't wise to rest your hopes on a 33 year old. My suggestion is to sign Parrot and maybe another more proven striker and develop them while Vardy can still work as their first choice to have a good backup in good time.

**Liverpool: Dayot Upamecano**. Good center back to cover for the injuries. If not a purchase then a loan with option to buy. Pretty simple.

**Man City: Kingsley Coman**. Goals needed. Goalscorer of UCL winning goal and treble winner. Outside shot, could become excellent under Pep. If he doesn't instantly take to the EPL though expect many ""flop"" messages.

**Man United: James Justin**. The easy choice for this would be a Pogba replacement. However, I personally think Donny van de Beek is the best option to replace him. James Justin is an outside shot for the left back position, which definitely needs reinforcement with Luke Shaw being the only/best option there. Brandon Williams is nothing compared to Justin, who's had a decent season at Leicester.

**Newcastle United: Ben White**. If Ashley actually opens his wallet for the first time in millenia (barring last summer), Ben White could reinforce the back line at Newcastle to push them even further from the relegation zone. Could cost them upwards of 30m, so a cheaper option may be needed

**Sheffield United: Juan Mata**. This would be a desperate signing without a doubt, but it might actually work. If Wilder can stomach changing to a new system and allowing Mata to be their main playmaker, it might not leave them last. Not saying they would survive, but Mata is a realistic signing who could provide some temporary relief or at the very least a win.

**Southampton: Sergio Romero**. Not to say that Southampton's goalkeepers are not EPL quality, but to be up at the top they need a stronger goalie. Romero doesn't instantly come to mind, but the stats back him to be the best backup goalie in practically the world.

**Spurs: Julian Weigl**. He is the perfect Mourinho player. He can work in the midfield or at the back, young but old enough to be in his prime, and would be perfect cover at Spurs for Alderweireld and Hojberg. 

**West Brom: Olivier Giroud**. Unlikely. But West Brom need a good striker desperately and Lampard's delusions about Tammy at striker and Werner at the wing means it could actually be done. Goals are needed and he can provide them.

**West Ham: John Brooks**. Not particularly great, but a good center back to keep West Ham from conceding goals, which would be much appreciated considering their lack of effective center backs.

**Wolves: Thilo Kehrer**. Seeing Kilman at CB is great considering my widespread condemnation of it (youth talents getting efficient game time) not happening enough, but it also means it's the easiest spot for me to improve so I'm going to be a hypocrite just this once and any other time I see fit. Thilo Kehrer has flown under the radar of impressive young talents, not seeming out of place at one of the biggest teams in Europe. Kilman could definitely still develop and maybe even compete with Kehrer, but either way an improvement would be made.

I’m amazed at how Kane can turn into a playmaker instantly but other times be such a prolific goalscorer. Heung-Min Son has scored a lot of goals too this season thanks to Kane. I still  can’t wrap my head around the fact that the pair have linked up 13 times in half a season, and the striker has gotten more of the assists.

"Just saw some post on this subreddit saying ""Why isnt Pep Guardiola getting any criticsm?"". Maybe because its not his fault? When theres a problem at a football club, you dont just point fingers at the manager unless if hes actually the problem. Is the most decorated manager in history the problem? Or is it the simple fact that your attack just forgot how to finish? Pep Guardiola isnt a puppet master. Hes not the one whos supposed to be scoring into an open net from 2 yards out (Im looking at you Raheem). And its not just that, you actually have City fans who want Pep out. Have they forgot all hes done for them? 100 point season, back to back prems, and fourmidables? 

You also got Mikel Arteta, he came in and instantly transformed Arsenals playstyle. They went on to beat some of the best teams and won 1 and a half trophy (yes, im talking about the community shield. cant count that as a full trophy). He started the season quite shit, but does form not exist for managers? Aubameyang has scored like 1 goal all season and you dont see Arsenal fans saying he should fuck off. Artetas doing good now as well. This was a problem with Unai Emery as well. He almost got them a top 4 finish, had that unbeaten run for a fair amount of time for Arsenal, took them to a Europa League final then the fans turned on him and he lost all his confidence. And his players turned on him as well. Its not gonna get better no shit.

He also has the best H2H record amongst the two managers(vs Ole: 2 meetings WW.  vs Lampard: 4 meetings LDWW). Also for some extra icing, Arteta has a better win record against Klopp than anyone listed(4 meetings WWLW). That's pretty good for someone who only managed a team for 10 months(that's when Arteta last met Klopp) in his managerial career.

Ole second cuz although he doesn't have any silverware he is currently 2nd place in the prem, placing better than Arteta and Lampard currently. He also got United to 3rd last season with a masterclass signing of Bruno(what a player)

&amp;#x200B;

Lampard last place by a mile cuz his only decent achievement was reaching the FA cup final and finishing 4th last season in the league. He spent 250M to sit 8th. Arteta and Ole would most likely perform better if they got that sort of backing.

"Just seen the penalty United have been given against Villa and hear Gary Neville praising Paul Pogba for being clever for taking a fall once Douglas Luiz puts his arm on him and honestly it’s so infuriating to see football reduced to this. We see some fantastic players get praised for being clever and falling under minimal contact (and it’s all clubs there’s no bias here, we see it from Salah, Kane, Fernandes and Vardy on a consistent basis) and rather than see it being called out and criticised, pundits are now praising it and calling it intelligent play. 

I don’t think I would mind VAR if it actually resulted in these calls being ruled out, but I feel VAR with its constant replaying and zooming of minimal frames if anything gives more free kicks and penalties for any theatrics like this. Of course this isn’t a VAR issue, a rule change needs to be implemented to fix this and actually punish players for this (seriously what happened to booking players who dive?)",Can we stop praising players for being clever for taking a dive?

"For example, Werner. He scored 28 goals last season in a system built for him. You could see a large amount of his goals coming from his breakaway abilities. Meanwhile, Lampard has him playing as a left winger half the time. He doesn't have the same effect, even if he has the attributes for it. Havertz is being talked about being a flop as well, even though he's been injured half the time and not performed all too poorly in general. This has been happening for a while, with Morata and Keita and so many others at other teams. Just because you have one good season doesn't mean you have the best passing range in Europe. Just because you work well in one system in one league doesn't mean the same is true for another system in another league. People should stop complaining when a player isn't instantly the best at their team when they were hyping up their potential instead of their abilities. This has happened time and time again. 

Instead of signing your Havertzs and Werners and Moratas who have just had a great season under a different system, instead consider signing somebody like Mendy who has a proven track record outside of media attention. Somebody like Luuk de Jong could probably score 10+ EPL goals a season but he's not talked about because he hasn't played for a ""big team"" yet even though he has a Europa League title under his belt. Julian Weigl could probably act as a midfield pivot for any team outside of the biggest few, but he's not talked about because he didn't ""reach his potential"" at Dortmund. Wout Weghorst hasn't been talked about at all in footballing circles even though he's led his team by scoring 9 in 13 in the Bundesliga, and is now starting to see some transfer rumors to Spurs. Let me predict what his career will be like if he makes this move: He'll join them, be unable to break through the Kane-Son dynamic, be called a ""flop"" because he scored once in the 5 games he was provided since Troy Parrot received more attention than him, build his career back at the age of 30 in a different league or at a lower level team like Crystal Palace, and eventually will be known as ""that guy who flopped at Spurs"" even though his career was so much bigger than that.

"What's the evidence for that?

If you take a look at everyone's average position and accomplishments for the previous 6 years (ever since Leicester were promoted):

Man City: 2.17 (2 PL Titles, 1 FA Cup, 4 League Cup, 2 Community Shields)

Spurs: 3.83 (none)

Chelsea: 4 (2 PL Titles, 1 EL Title, 1 FA cup, 1 League Cup)

Liverpool: 4.17 (1 PL Title, 1 CL Title, 1 Club World Cup, 1 Super Cup)

Arsenal: 4.83 (3 FA Cups, 3 Community Shields)

Leicester: 8.33 (1 PL Title)

With this being said, as poor as Arsenal have been in the last year and a half they have only finished outside the top 6 once, similar to both Liverpool and Chelsea.

Why are they able to get away with it? Is that the only way to get a foul call in the Prem now? Is it on the refs? Is it on the players for being soft and going to ground way too easily?

"It's Mourinho's inability to recognise a problem on the pitch if it concerns his favourite players. Kane and Son should not have played that much. Or at all tbh. They've both looked increasingly poorer and slower recently, they clearly need a rest. Vinicius has done a job in Europa. Lamela, Moura and Bergwijn can do jobs on the wings. Alli can do a job as a second striker. They had no choice but to defend for 90 minutes because the attack was so poor. If that was Dele Alli playing like that he'd have come off in the first half.

As soon as Ndombele went off they had no chance. He's the only one that could hold up a ball up there. What was the point of not playing him at all against Leicester when they actually needed him, for him to only play 60 minutes again tonight? And having both Hojbjerg and Winks sit even when in possession when they're playing 3 at the back as well is ridiculous. They were clearly missing an extra man going forward.

"Who’ve been your signings of the season for PL clubs? In no particular order, mine go...

Gabriel (Arsenal) - Currently looks like Arsenal’s only competent defender, you’d shudder to imagine  where they’d be without him. 

Watkins (Villa) - Really great all around striker, strong, fast and a great finisher on the ground or in the air. Spearheads Villa’s attack better than Wesley or Samatta and looks a menace whenever he’s on the pitch. 

Torres (City) - Really young, great fee and looks like becoming a star already under Guardiola. 

Martinez (Villa) - Villa’s unsung hero this season and maybe the most consistent shot-stopper in the league behind Alisson, Martinez makes you wonder why Chelsea didn’t go for him over Mendy. 

Allan (Everton) - The perfect anchor to a midfield containing more attacking options and one of the best DMs in Europe for almost 5 years, all for less than €30m. Only nitpick is his age, but for such a low fee he still makes it in. 

Lookman (Fulham) - Has looked absolutely electric for Fulham this season. Seemed underwhelming as a loan deal, but at this rate Fulham and every club in England should be vying to get him out of Leipzig this Summer. Huge key pass and dribble numbers and bear in mind that he’s still only 23. 

Fofana (Leicester) - Huge fee but for a 19-year old I don’t think anyone could have expected him to slot straight in to a top-4 challenging defense. Really astute signing shows that Leicester have still got it when looking for incredibly talented youth. 

Jota (Liverpool) - 12 goals and 2 assists in under 1200 league/UCL/cup minutes. Liverpool are lucky they didn’t go for Ismaila Sarr instead. 

Thiago (Liverpool) - Not had much of a chance to show it yet, but the best midfielder in the world for €30m is an unreal bargain. 

Hojbjerg (Spurs) - Exactly what Spurs needed in the midfield. Hojbjerg adds some steel to a midfield commonly criticized for being soft, as well as a great range of passing and an assured touch when in possession. When you consider that the deal basically works out to €3m + Kyle Walker-Peters, it’s a slam dunk. 

Coufal (West Ham) - The second acquisition from Slavia Prague in as many windows, Coufal’s strength and defensive mettle makes you wonder what other bargains are there to be had outside of Europe’s top 5 leagues.

Thiago Silva (Chelsea) - Added in by popular demand and due to the fact I completely overlooked him, Silva has provided maturity and stability to a young Chelsea side for the low cost of his wages.",Signings of the Season

"I include realistically because while we would all love to sign Van Dijk Neuer Lewandowski Ronaldo and Ramos, that might be a bit of a stretch 😅

As a city fan, after watching most of our games this season, especially the last couple, it seems straightforward enough. We need someone who can finish chances with 100% consistency. Sterling Torres Mahrez Bernardo are all phenomenal players but in their instinct, as wingers who often assist, they can’t be called upon to finish chances as much as we need. As a result we throw away anywhere from 1-3 scoreable chances a game.

"I love Frank Lampard and he's my second favorite player of all time behind Didier Drogba. I have wanted him to succeed this whole time and still do. Nothing would make me happier than him succeeding as manager and Chelsea winning the league with him. However, as a lifelong Chelsea fan I will always put the success of my club first. Multiple players mentioned that they chose to come to Chelsea due to Frank Lampard being here (Werner, Havertz and even Haaland said something along those lines). I believe he did a great job last year making it to the FA Cup Final (we should have won that) and finishing in the Top 4 with a transfer ban. We spent 250+ million this summer on absolutely brilliant players (Werner = 2 most goal contributions in Bundesliga, Havertz = one of the most highly touted young players in the world, Ziyech = someone who should have come to the Prem long ago, Chilwell = a top left back in the Prem, Mendy = stop gap goalkeeper and Silva = aging but still top level CB). We came into this season knowing that the plan was to close the gap on Liverpool and Man City this season and have top 4 and trophy as a BARE MINIMUM. We started this season with Kepa in goal and struggled even though we were playing teams that should not cause us problems (outside of Liverpool of course). Me and other fans made excuses about Kepa's mistakes and injuries against West Brom, Southampton and Liverpool. We went on a 17 game unbeaten streak while performing well in Europe and everyone was gassed up and claiming we were realistic title challengers and potentially UCL winners. Meanwhile nobody realized that none of the teams we beat were in the top 10 of the league. Then we had a shocker against Everton and Wolves, which in my opinion exposed the weakness of Lampard's tactics. We consistently play Timo on the wing (he's not a fucking winger and sucks there.. it's plain for everyone to see), we haven't played Kai in the correct position all season (he's a 10) and we INSIST on crossing the ball when we play Tammy up top (who can't win a header for his life.. look at the Spurs, Krasnodar, Arsenal games). Lampard's substitutions also make absolutely no sense, we didn't bring on Giroud when he's not only on form but also all we're doing is crossing for example (34 crosses, he also had Timo, Tammy and Giroud all on the field at the same time in one game). He also played a 50% Reece James and Ben Chilwell who were injured when we have a proven albeit aging RB in Azpi (our club captain btw) and Emerson who played absolutely fine against West Ham. He brought on Jorginho who doesn't progress the ball and played poor against West Ham as well. We are 15 points behind where we were at this point last season as well. I could say much more if anyone else is curious but this is a novel at this point.",Lampard Out (except there are no top managers really available anymore): And this is why...

"Now, I know what you are thinking - just pick the best 18, right? Well, not necessarily. I can choose a heavily attacking side with Sterling, Mahrez, Salah, Rashford, Mane, Bruno, Son and Kane, but is this team realistically outscoring the opponent for 38 games? No, there needs to be some strategy into choosing the best all-around team. Plus, for the sake of it being more interesting, you gotta think about non-quantifiable factors like - who will be the big start, who will be pulling the strings in the midfield, are you gonna pick very offensive wing backs and if yes - maybe a CDM extra to cover the spaces behind them?   


Rules for participating:

* **Max 3 players per team -** the idea is not to pick Liverpool's team and add De Bryune and Maguire (haha)
* **Pick the formation you want -** 3-4-3, 4-4-2, anything you would like to play 
* **It's based on players right now, not their potential -** picking a team of the Lampteys, Curtis Joneses and Pedro Netos of the world would be fun but realistically they are not breaking the record 

No more rules - let's play! 

**Starting 11:**

1. **GK - Alisson -** Alisson wins us 15 points by himself, just making those 1 or 2 sensational saves per game that keep us in a game/save us a tight game. Very easy choice. 
2. **RB - Kyle Walker -** provides defensive stability, can play as the right CB in a back three and on offence can still produce, albeit not as much as Trent Alexander Arnold. Walker is the man for the right.
3. **CB - Conor Coady -** I will never not say that he is one of the best CBs in the league. In a back 4 they could be sensational.
4. **CB - Virgil Van Dijk -** I mean, when he's playing he is the best CB in the world. Remember, people were saying he was better than Messi. That's insane for a defender.
5. **LB - Ben Chilwell -** this season for Chelsea he was even better than last year, capable on the back and as dangerous as ever on the front.
6. **CDM - N'Golo Kante -** having infront of these 4 basically locks my defence. It's unplayable - Kante's there and then if you pass by him you face a wall. These defence alone is getting 27 to 30 clean sheets. 
7. **CM - Paul Pogba -** not only Kante locks the defence, but he unlocks Pogba. Example? Look no further than World Cup 2018 where Pogba and Kante played together and we all saw what happened. 
8. **CM - Kevin De Bryune -** basically have De Bryune be the more offensive midfielder out of the three.
9. **RW - Mohamed Salah -** for me Salah is the second best player in the Premier League and the best right wing in the world. Look at his numbers - since joining Liverpool probably only Messi and Lewa have more goals than him. 
10. **LW - Heung-Min Son -** what can I say - he is different. With these passers he gets three, four chances per game and with his ratio of goals/shots, that guarantees goals.
11. **ST - Jamie Vardy -** I know Harry Kane plays in the PL, but again, with this passing Vardy will get so many chances. He is also way better in a possession play than people think.

**Reserves:**

1. **Nick Pope -** so underrated. Nick Pope filling in for Alisson sounds like a dream.
2. **Thiago Silva -** the idea of Silva being on the bench is that he is quite old so I don't want him to play every game. Rotate the starting two, start every other game. When he plays he is always dominant. 
3. **Reece James -** perfect choice from the bench to give Walker some air. 
4. **Jack Grealish -** someone parked the bus against us, it's 75th minute and it's 0-0, what do we do? Easy, put Grealish in and he will find the gap in the opponent's defence.
5. **Raheem Sterling -** Son terrorized the opponent's right back in the first half, he is tired and has a yellow. And now he will defend against a well-rested Sterling for 45 minutes! Yikes.
6. **Harry Kane -** this bench is making me feel anxious for the other side. Kane from the bench? What?
7. **Wilfried Ndidi -** Kante will cover a lot for the attacking players and he needs to have a player coming off the bench to cover for him.

With this my side is finished. In a normal game you have De Bryune and Pogba pushing balls forward to the three speedsters and if the opponent parks the bus, you can put Grealish in to empty pockets, Sterling to make them uncomfortable and Harry Kane to annihilate.

"I'll be honest, I now try to avoid anything on twitter specifically, but also media response to Leeds matches as a whole. While it's nice to watch the praise for wins, some of the opinions and views of pundits, fans of other teams and even Leeds fans, just hurt my head. So I wanted to put my honest views on everything Leeds related, just to see what other Leeds fans think, if anyone agrees/disagrees, but also what other fans of other teams think.

To start with, in all honesty the expectation from the media for Leeds this season took me by surprise. Sure, we play exciting football, and having watched it for over 2 years it's become normal though I'm reminded watching other team's games how good the football is (don't get me wrong, losing is still losing and not a great feeling, but as for the quality of football and excitement when I watch, it's great), but that doesn't mean we'll be a team challenging for Europe like I saw at the start of the season.From all honest Leeds fans (because we all have those crazy fans), our aim is, and always has been the same as any promoted from Championship. Survival. I'm not in a dream world as to the relaity of what we should expect to achieve as a team. I would take a goal difference survival, a couple points survival, hell, even a goal line technology malfunction survival (Just a joke Villa fans, nothing serious). After 16 years out of the Prem, where it was looking more and more likely we'd be forever a Championship team, with the odd upset in playoffs/scare of relegation to League 1, I want nothing more than to just stay in the Premier League.

As for the love Bielsa gets, it's all based on his footballing impact, not accolades and trophies. He has a clear style of play, and he implements it at every club he goes to, win, lose or spanking (As we saw on Sunday). I think a lot of that admiration from people for him gets mixed for expecting him to be making Leeds a team challenging the top 6 (Or so it feels). People aren't followers of him or lovers of him because he wins trophies and tactically outclasses managers left right and centre, but for the exciting and clear style no matter the opponent, and how he is football mad in every way. He's an intriguing manager, which a strange personality and a pure passion for football as a game. Manchester United's starting 11 cost around £400m, and Leeds's cost around £70m. You'd never expect to win that game with any manager, so it's no surprise we lost. I wouldn't choose to lose heavy but it will happen with how we play, Bielsa's coaching and play style doesn't work miracles to overturn teams with starting lineups over 5x the price of ours (although some would argue our promotion seemed like a miracle for the majority of Leeds fans). But it does allow us to see our team actually compete with these teams and look like we can score just as easily as anyone, despite the clear weakness in our squad. That is what I admire.

&amp;#x200B;

Our performances in the league this season haven't been much different to teams in previous years who've stayed up, so I'm understandably happy with how we've played, even with some of the losses we've taken. We're doing well in relation to our avoid relegation target, and that is what I find important. But there's plenty of football to play, and many points to be won/lost, so I'm not naive to the possibility of relegation, anything can happen, but as things stand we're on track.

For me personally, I use watching Leeds now more than ever as an escape from the real world, from the upset of being in a tier 4 area over Christmas, and stresses of working in a critical worker sector right through all the lockdowns. This year has been hard for everyone, each of us with our own struggles and battles, but I'm glad football can continue, and I'm even happier knowing I can watch us play like we do. I don't think we're 'better' than any team because of it, morally or tactically. I just enjoy the viewing pleasure of how the players have bought into the exciting playstyle, and I'll make the most of it even if it results in relegation. I am and always be a Leeds fan, and regardless of the outcome of the season, I'll always appreciate that Bielsa has sparked my interest in Leeds to its maximum I've experienced (As a 20yr old fan whose only ever remembered/experienced doom and gloom), and given us hope that we can get back to being a 'big' team some day, even if that is many many years down the line.

For any offside call with the difference between the last player and the opposite teams player being less than x mm, it should be a linesman call i.e. whatever the linesman ruled in real time.

Even if things do get somewhat better as the season wears on (which I'm doubtful of), I think Arsenal should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.

For me, even as a Liverpool fan through and through, I have to nominate Manchester United.

First and foremost, the full stadium wrap with not just the first tier of seats being wrapped, but the whole stadium. That added with a majority of the stadium being filled with pictures of fans that cannot make the game, gives a personal and fan friendly customisation that no other club really gives. And then with the HATRED (with the HAT crossed out to just spell red) along with other ""United against racism"" wraps that coordinates with the fight against racism campaign is a touch of class.

"Glad the concussion sub rule is coming in, fine with staying at 3 subs, but it got me thinking about other things that could be changed.

I’d like to see diving be penalised retroactively. I know in the NBA the referees review every decision (or non-decision) after the game, so if the same is done with football matches it should be pretty easy to identify dives (successful or otherwise). I think if you start handing out 1-match suspensions, players will be much less likely to dive.

I’d also like to see the 6-second rule actually be applied. This is in part to quell time wasting late on, but also just to speed up the play. Keepers take 10-15 seconds almost every time, more when they’re winning late on and go to ground after making a straightforward catch...I’d kinda like to see the how actually adhering to the rule affects play.

Finally, another one that’s already a rule but not implemented, I’d like to see bookings (and thus stopping players from doing it) when they stop a quick fee kick or throw. Like players commit a foul then grab the ball, or they just stand in front of the ball and stuff. I dunno, I’d like to see the game run more smoothly.

" On the eve of the central match of the 13th round of the English Championship between Liverpool and Tottenham, Jurgen Klopp praised Jose Mourinho’s team. 

 ***“The way Tottenham is playing this year is really impressive,”*** ***the BBC quotes the head coach of Liverpool. “Mourinho turned his team into a scoring machine, but with a very attractive game.” “It is especially worth noting that even if the game is not perfect for Tottenham, they win through a well-coordinated defense, collective action and the ability to turn the tide of the meeting.” “At the same time, danger can come from any football player. If you shut down Son and Kane, it does not mean that you are safe. Everyone in Tottenham knows what is required of him, but at the same time, everyone can score. Well, Kane and Son Heung-min understand each other so well that they may not interact at all during the match, and then “turn on” and make a result. “***

The match Liverpool – Tottenham will take place on Wednesday 16 December.

"Wanted to ask if there are any Manchester United fans that still want Pogba in their club?

 After what his agent said last week about him needing to leave, then Pogba pledging his commitment,and now again his agent saying it would not be in the transfer window. Not a Utd fan, but if I was, I could not believe Pogba's commitment, both on and off the pitch. Just the fact that he has kept his agent on means that what is agent says is what Pogba thinks. And now his agent is telling Utd what to do with him.... It almost feels like his agent is the owner. The pair of them act like they are above the club.

"I was watching back Aston Villa's highlights against Wolves.

At 5:25 in this video, John McGinn is fouled and a penalty awarded: [https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906](https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906)

In the video, you can clearly hear the sound of players colliding. Even as a Villa fan I thought there wasn't much contact at the time. I can completely imagine the ref using his ears as well as his eyes to make the decision. In this instance, it wasn't overturned.

However, there have been other penalty decisions overturned. Since lockdown, teams have mostly been playing in empty stadiums, where you can hear more of the action.

I wonder if referees are using their ears more to make decisions. Then, when reviewing the slowed-down footage (either at Stockley Park or pitchside), they no longer use that audio. From different angles, contact between two players can look better or worse.

My theory is that in some cases, referees see what looks like contact, and their ears confirm it for them. However, on review, and without audio, that's overturned.

If that is the case (and someone with access to stats could check it), then a lo-fi option would be to keep the audio during reviews (if they don't already). Sports like cricket use snick-o-meters to determine how much contact was made between bat and ball.

As crowds return the pitchside mics may pick up less, but keeping the audio could be a useful signal to officials trying to decide whether, and how much contact was made, especially when it's unclear from different camera angles.",Does lack of audio during reviews impact VAR decisions?

"The term sleepwalking towards disaster is well and truly applicable too Arsenal, from the days of consistently finishing 4th and gloating about it too now being an outright shambles, every step Arsenal have taken as a club has led them to this moment. From transfer strategy too management, everything is wrong structurally, and frankly with or without Mikel Arteta I think results wouldn’t be different. 

This is a problem that I believe could last up to a decade or beyond. I saw it with Liverpool (who probably started from a worse position in terms of squad and management before arriving too the brendan Rodgers and now loool era’s) and we can see it now with United where issues have remained permanently since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. 

The worst part is the Arsenal fans. Who have now reared there true ugly heads (IMO). They are completely spineless, this is just based on the differing reactions from Liverpool and United fans when there clubs had/have fallen into turmoil. One win gets blown out of proportion, and a loss is the end of there club. These run of results should act as a humbling, yes Arsenal are a “big club”, but I see no acceptance of the current situation. When Emery was in it was about getting rid of him to find a style and give an opportunity to the younger players, that was the Arteta plan. Now it’s again get rid of the manager, find a style and give a chance to the younger players. 

Xhaka has never been good enough, nor has elneny, mustafi or holding and get they consistently find themeselves with opportunities in the first team. Every player can play well for a short period of time but it’s inevitable that the flaws which hinder them from being truly elite players will rear themselves, which is perfectly fine, however Arsenal fans seem to disillusion themselves by a few good performances and then expect the good performance to become permanent.

"I know players looking for fouls is nothing new but this season it seems like it's happening constantly. Will be watching a game and it'll constantly be broken up by someone collapsing to the floor screaming cos they got poked and will win a foul or the ball will be kicked out to see if they're ok, even though they are completely fine and there was never enough enough contact for that.

I feel like players know especially with VAR that any contact no matter how minimal will result in a foul as long as they fall over, e.g. the Robertson foul on welbeck. Players have also stopped competing for aerial battles cos they know if the other player jumps they can get a foul by falling over and saying they jumped into them, Joe Roden did that like 3 or 4 times in the match against Chelsea. Idk if I'm just noticing it more but it definitely feels more common and its making games really shit to watch and there's no exciting physical battles.

At the moment all the top 6 teams are so scared of slipping up in one of the big matches and so they don’t do anything risky and the end result is just a boring match that usually finishes 0-0 with most of the possession in midfield and hardly any attacking play.

In all honesty the only ‘exciting’ top 6 game was Spurs (6) vs Man Utd (1) and even that was boring in the way that it was so one-sided.

While United and Liverpool are rivals, I like watching United do well. Especially, in the Ferguson days, I felt like United could dig really deep for a result even when their players were having an off day - it kind of reminds of how Liverpool plays now. 

Ole is a strange one. Whenever I see him on the touch line or interviews, it seems as though he’s not in control of the team.  I’m finding it difficult to put it into words but it just seems different from his Cardiff days when it felt like he was in charge. When United are having an off day, I’ve not seen Ole really take charge. For a lack of a better word, Ole seems a little clueless. I’ve noticed this even when the team is playing well. 

I really like United players - I think Rashford and Bruno are going to be world beaters and Pogba needs to find some form. Do you United fans feel like your players are lacking some inspiration or a more authoritative manager?

"Last season they were being tipped as outsiders for UCL at one point. Now they'll need a miracle to escape relegation. 11 games so far this season, only a singular point picked up. What has gone wrong?

An interesting point to start on is Sheffield's wage bill: Only Leeds United come close in how little is spent on player wages. They're currently around the $20m USD mark, upgrading $4-5m since last season. For reference, Mesut Özil's salary is about the same as the entire Sheffield United team. Phil Jagielka is their best paid player.

Tactically, Sheffield play a 5-at-the-back, with a formidable center 3 being key to their good results last season. However, this time around, injuries have hit hard. Jack O'Connell's statistics show how well Sheffield perform with and without him: Sheffield win 475% more games with him, get 3 times more points per game, and concede half the amount of goals. Attempts to move around players to fix this haven't worked: they lack physicality, awareness, and pure quality. It's easy to see just how hard this has affected Sheffield as a whole.

Up front as well, Lys Mousset's lack of performances has left Sheffield stranded. And no offense to everybody in Sheffield's attack, but they need to improve heavily if they want to survive this season. In winter, a striker needs to be signed who can finish goals. If Sheffield's defense can partially recover themselves, and the attack can be improved to get Sheffield playing at last season's level, perhaps they won't see themselves facing Championship teams next season",What's gone wrong at Sheffield United this season?

"As a newer fan to the PL and recently paying more attention to all the clubs and how they are doing, What do you think contributed to teams quick starts (Everton, Aston Villa, etc.) and there now falling off back into maybe more ""normal positions"" in the table for them? And vice versa for teams who started off badly but have now picked up the pace (ManU and Man City) what have they done to improve? Lastly, what do you think is the biggest contributor to Arsenal performing so poorly?

I feel a managers duties are to put out the best side each and every performance while also maintaining so rest for players in big stretches. I also think they are there to motivate players and challenge them to grow in aspects of their game that need development. However, a manager can only do so much and as much as they want their to perform the best, they cant actually control how the team goes out and plays. I see a lot of Arsenal fans who want to blame Arteta for Arsenals performances and my question is just why do you think he's to blame? Is he not putting out the best lineup? Again, I feel its a bit harsh to throw all criticism at a manager because the players are the ones actually out their on the pitch and he cant control the fact that someone like Aubameyang hasn't scored a game time goal in however many matches its been.

"As another year soon comes to a close we see yet another year without the first openly gay Premier League player. This is not a problem most of us think about on a daily basis, but we really should.

Can you imagine? It's 2020 and gay footballers are still having to hide their true identities. Almost every other major industry has openly gay celebrities and influencers. Why is football (and sport in general) lagging so much behind?

My first thoughts were along the lines of players being afraid of their teammates' reactions. That they'd be afraid they might not be wanted in the locker room anymore because they shower together and so forth. Then I learned that [a number of gay players have come out to their teammates but not to the outside world](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/26/20-footballers-have-told-me-theyre-gay-says-top-football-boss/). Naturally, that is not to say that it doesn't play a role. The fear comes from a number of different factors and it differs between players. One huge factor is undoubtedly the reactions of us, the fans.

The problem of coming out was emphasized by an unnamed gay player of the Premier League [in an open letter](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/read-gay-premier-league-stars-22338520) earlier this year where he says: ""Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare. And it is affecting my mental health more and more. I feel trapped and my fear is that disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse"". Furthermore, he states that ""I just don’t think football is ready yet for a player to come out"". I recommend you read the full letter, and to the player behind it, whoever you are, thank you for speaking out.

I think it is time that we as fans show the stars we all know and love that their sexuality does not affect our opinion of them. We need to make them feel welcome. We need to show them that football is ready for players to be themselves.

Will every single fan be supportive? Unfortunately, no. However, I firmly believe that a large majority of fans will be supportive and drown out the voices of the few.

Understandably, it is very hard to be the first player to come out of the closet. However, as we have seen in the past, these things become easier for each person following the last. Hopefully, we will see the first openly gay Premier League player soon. And the second. And the third. Until suddenly we will be shaking our heads that this was ever a problem in the first place.

To all the gay footballers in the Premier League (or elsewhere), if you ever read this, I want to say the following:

&gt;I support you and welcome your sexuality. I don't want you to live your life hiding who you are. I don't want you to have to live your golden years in mental agony. I want you to feel safe, loved, and supported as the person you truly are, because you deserve it. I understand that you might not feel ready to come out and I respect that, but if you are, know that I am ready for you.

If football is ever going to be ready, we need to show both our current and future gay stars that we care. Many of our favorite activities might be closed due to the pandemic, but we can show our beloved players that football is **open** for gays. #FootballIsOpenForGays

1. Surely the best way to play is the way that wins you games instead of trying to play into the opponents’ hands.

2. Why do they feel like they know better than the best manager of the last 15 years

3. Spurs players haven’t won a trophy and if a man comes in that has won everything in his career and tells you that you can win by doing it this way, surely you won’t have a problem with following his instructions.

"What happened to that club? I'm a Chelsea fan, so there's obviously a part of me that enjoys their misery. That said, I'm pretty shocked at how the fortunes have reversed. 

I remember 5 years ago, Chelsea was a midtable club that was in danger of being relegated for a part of the season while Arsenal was playing attacking football with Alexis Sanchez, Ozil, and Giroud leading the charge. They also were doing good business by developing the young talent and then buying from the outside at great prices to fill in the gaps/keep the squad competitive. I think they also had managed all or most of their stadium debt, so it seemed like the future was bright. They had the combination of good youth players, world class talent (Sanchez/Ozil at that time), and a self-sustaining model.

Now, look at them. They've spent almost as much as Chelsea, but have made horrible transfer purchases (Pepe), haven't gotten any results from their stars after handing them fat contracts (Ozil and Aubameyang thus far), and don't seem to be producing any Jack Wilshere or Theo Walcott type of talents from their academy anymore.

What led to quick and sudden decline? After missing champions league once, it seems they completely fell off, despite a supposedly self-sustaining model.

Both players were grounded, with Luiz having a significant gash on the head which causes frequent bleeding during the match, and Jimenez actually being knocked unconscious as a result of the collision. It was reported Jimenez was out of it for around 10 minutes before regaining consciousness.

**Transcript:**

When you see 2 players collide like this, very similarly to the Bailly Maguire incident for United last year in the Fa Cup semi-final vs Chelsea, the 1st thing that comes to mind is potential concussions. The Fa and Premier League have been called out by pundits multiple times over the last few years particularly around this subject saying players do not have enough protection from these injuries and teams should be allowed to have temporary concussion substitutes. From a health standpoint I really like this recommendation because it removes the pressure on a manager to keep a player on in fear of using up an unnecessary sub and gives the injured player the most ample chance to recover and be assessed in that short amount of time.

Recently in the last few years the Fa introduced a concussion protocol for teams to follow depending on the league they are in. Regardless of who you play for, if a player (in this case Luiz and Jimenez) suffers a head injury the 1st thing you need to do as the healthcare professional is DR ABC (Danger, Response, Airways, Breathing and Cardiovascular) and assess for evidence of a concussion. A concussion is a term thrown around a lot in the media, but what does it actually mean in a medical context. A concussion ‘medically’ refers to a mild traumatic brain injury often caused by a bump or significant knock to the head which causes the brain to hit the inside of the skull. This can also occur when a person experiences whiplash.

When you have a player that has been involved in a head collision or injury, at first we are going to assess them and find out if they are showing any symptoms of concussion like dizziness &amp; headache. However in addition to asking them if they are experiencing any of these, something is to consider is players may not be telling the truth because they want to play particularly in situations where they are in the last year of their contract or fighting for a spot in the 1st team. So to control for this, we would ask a few questions testing for memory disturbance such as

1. What venue are you at today?
2. What half is it now?
3. Who scored last in the game?
4. Did you team win the last game?

Any incorrectly answered question may indicate that potentially a player is suffering from concussion however bear in mind someone with a brain injury may still be able to answer these correctly. In that very short time, the clinician has to make a decision whether they think a player has suffered a concussion or brain injury, which can be an extreme burden if a team is chasing a game and the star gets injured or big games are coming up. However, as the clinician you must isolate yourself from the surroundings and decide what is best for the player and only the player. If any potential signs of concussion arise, there is only 1 option. Take them to hospital for full and detailed health checks looking for possibility of brain injuries. Personally I have only been involved in 2 concussion checks live in a football match and both instances the player was ok and allowed to continue.

With David Luiz we can assume there were no signs of a concussion as he was able to play on by the Arsenal Medical team, however the big contention was surrounding why he was allowed to continue if blood was dripping down and if he was just not showing signs of injury. This is where the debate comes in, as the current rules say players who pass the concussion protocol test can continue to play and gashes as long as they can be controlled are minor occurrences as we have seen in Premier League history with many players wearing bandages around their heads during matches.

For regular concussion protocol players at the highest level of football with access to the best immediate treatment are scheduled to return after 1 week (6 days to be precise) and 12 days if 17-19. In grassroots football, this extends to 2-3 weeks depending on symptoms and if players are assessed as fit to return by healthcare staff at the respective clubs.

With Jimenez’s injury, things get more difficult because it has been reported he suffered a skull fracture as a result of the collision with Luiz. 2 Players I know off have suffered these injuries in the past, Petr Cech most famously who was able to return to play after a period out and become a Chelsea legend. Secondly. Ryan Mason who’s career was unfortunately ended as a result of the injury. From a medical standpoint, I am not too worried about the actual fracture as breaks in bones can always be fixed, reattached or connected using a metal plate (see full video for image of fixed skull). The more concerning matter at hand is the traumatic brain injury experienced however it will be interesting to see if Jimenez’s heading ability is affected by the injury or if his skull is more susceptible if something similar happens again.

“A skull fracture is one thing, the other more serious issues tend to be what’s going on with the underlying tissues,” says Dr Michael Grey, of the University of East Anglia. “Recovery wise, the fracture itself is less of an issue. The bones will repair themselves. They’ll start to fuse within two to three weeks, and it will be more or less solid again in six weeks.”

Yes the bones have to heal, but the real challenge I feel will be the making sure there are no neurological defects that may arise in the short term or potentially manifest itself later on in the future. **So, when will Jimenez return, based on all the information not a for a while is the best answer**. Even though its vague if we look at what Dr Grey said the skull alone with take around 6 weeks, but the time out is truly dependent on neurological symptoms. **If Jimenez shows any signs of degeneration neurologically this could end up very sadly for him with a potential career end but let’s all hope that doesn’t happen and he is able to return safe and healthy when the time is right**.

"**Yes I am a Chelsea fan but I truly believe the points I make are unbiased facts.** 

So I just think that Lampard is doing really well with Chelsea, has shown signs of being a great tactician, adaptable to situations, not just a one trick pony and can win things with Chelsea.   
Since he has come in I have heard comparisons to him and Arteta saying ""Arteta worked under Pep he will show up Frank"" and ""Frank took Derby from 6th to 6th and took Chelsea from 3rd to 4th""  


I don't think people understand that to take a team into a Championship play off final in your FIRST EVER year as a manager is not a bad achievement. Also taking charge of a Chelsea side having gotten a transfer ban, brought in tonnes of youth players, lost their best player (Hazard) while other teams signed and improved.   


I also think that although last season they dropped lots of points to games they should have won due to individual errors, they performed great, have a really attractive style, have a go at teams. We played Liverpool 4 times last year, and in all of them games we were arguably the better team (maybe not in the 5-3) and would have won had we been more clinical.   


This season since Mendy and Silva have been regularly starting we have conceded like 4 goals in all comps, only lost to Liverpool (with 10 men for the second half, kepa giving away a goal and missing a penalty) and we have dropped points to WBA (due to alonso) and Southampton (due to kepa).   


Yes people can say we have spent loads and it should be expected, but the foundations for the style of play already existed last season. So to recap, Lampard is a great manager and is levels ahead of Ole and Arteta.",Lampard not getting enough credit and putting an end to the Arteta comparison.

"Hey all, another dumb American trying to get advice on what team to support here!

Some background, I am a huge sports fan and sports card collector that is trying to expand my watching and collecting horizons. I have typically only paid attention to baseball and American Football, but I recently have found myself wanting to watch and collect other sports as well. I have always loved baseball the most since I have a team I am dedicated to (go Yankees!), so I was wanting to get that same experience as I begin to watch Premier League matches.

After doing some browsing the common consensus seems to be to watch some matches and see who stands out to me, but for some reason that seems a bit impersonal to me. I am a Yankees fan because my family used to live in New York for generations, and I want that more personal connection to the team I support. This brought me to the idea of using Ancestry to figure out where my English ancestors were from. After a bit of digging I discovered that my 9th great-grandfather was born in Manchester before coming to the colonies in the early 1700's.

That helped me decide that I wanted to support a team from Manchester, but I know absolutely nothing about the differences between Manchester City and Manchester United. I was hoping to get a bit of help breaking down the clubs, their history, their fans, etc. between those two clubs so I can make a bit of a more informed decision before I start watching the matches more regularly. I have read a few things about each club, but since I don't have much background on the history of the league I was hoping to get more info on how the the clubs are perceived by those of you here. If any of you are fans of American Football or baseball as well and can make comparisons to teams from those sports as well that would be very helpful.

"I am an Arsenal fan and I posted the below in the Arsenal community and got a mixed review, I would love to know what is the general consensus and if in your comments you could state the team you support, for reference.... 

  
For me personally, league-wide, VAR has to stay but has to be used in the correct way, think back to before VAR and how many goals were disallowed for offside when the player was onside, or how many goals were given even though the linesmen got it wrong and they were, in fact, offside or even fouls that when you watch the replay should be an absolute stonewall red card and sometimes aren't even given a yellow for.

Imagine the Auba goal against man utd last year when he was clearly about a yard onside and the linesman got it wrong, went to VAR, and got given.... but this season the officiating quality has just slowly declined and declined, no other league has these issues and officials from other countries constantly get selected over British referees for champions league finals and European and world cup goams, why? because the referees here stink, there needs to be a substantial investment into the training of referees in this country.

  
It's not even just about the offsides and drawing lines incorrectly and taking 3 minutes to come to a decision, there should be more reviews on shirt pulling the in the box for a corner as I'm seeing it weekly now across different games that defenders are pulling the back of the attacker's shirts and there's never a penalty for this...?

Also referees seem to be too reliant on it and hesitant to make instant decisions, especially with penalties.
Beside the obvious need to re-visit the rules, should VAR be used with a challenge system like in tennis where a team get 2 or 3 challenges per match, if you get it wrong you lose a challenge? Can this be used for penalties at least if not offsides as players can’t really judge offsides?

"I may be an upset Villa fan, but I have channeled my frustration into this post and would like to make a point.

When VAR officials do their thing, they choose a still-frame of the moment when they deem the ball was passed. Analysis of that still frame is only appropriate when distances are scrutinised to the same precision, to which that still frame was chosen on.

**Some calculations:**

\- The impact or contact time between the passer's foot and the ball is ""approximately 0.01 s"" \[1\] and more precisely, around 7.5 ms \[2\].

\- A player making a run will most likely be sprinting at close to his peak velocity, which is approximately 9.2 m/s for a high-level, professional striker \[3\]. The highest measured sprint speed of a footballer was 10.6 m/s \[4\].

\- Thus, while the passer makes contact with the ball, the forward moves a distance of 0.069 m or around 7 cm (using values of 7.5 ms and 9.2 m/s for contact time and sprint speed respectively).

I certainly feel that sometimes, VAR officials aim to judge offside to distances equal to or smaller than 7 cm... Ollie Watkins' offside tonight was by far not the closest. This would be measuring offside to a precision greater than that of our measurement, the still frame.

**Some other points I want to make:**

\- An additional variable could be the last defender moving in the opposite direction at the same time, meaning the margin may well change by 2 \* 7 = 14 cm while the ball is being passed.

\- The time precision in selecting the still frame may well slightly exceed the ball impact time, as there is probably a slightly longer apparent impact time when not analysed close-up in slow motion.

\- At distances of a few centimetres, many other miniscule factors could come into play, such as the length of shirtsleeves...

TL;DR the point I want to make is that offside is being judged to a physically ridiculous and impossible precision. I am surprised (or not really...) the PL/FA/FIFA didn't pay somebody to do these calculations for them.

**Edit, to include: What should be done, how do we move forward**:

For consistency, I understand little can probably be changed this season. A simple solution for offside would be to use thicker lines and judge it to be ""on-side"" if the lines touch. 

I'm fundamentally pro-VAR, but I think it needs a complete revamp, or ""project restart"" next season. Scrap everything we have and start from scratch. Use case studies from the past seasons and other leagues to reimplement what worked and find solutions for what didn't work. Pool the knowledge and opinions of former players, referees and fan associations to rebuild a better VAR.

"I'm a West Ham fan and consider Tottenham, Chelsea and Millwall my team's main rivals. I've generally had a positive opinion of Arsenal and it's fans because: a) some of my extended family support them, b) the good football they played at the beginning of the millennium and c) Ian Wright was one of my earliest idols (that'll date me). I'm telling you this to give you a perspective of where this opinion is coming from.

I've noticed a steady decline of Arsenal since their peak when they had Henry, Bergkamp, Pires, Ljungberg, Campbell et al. (I mean everyone has) because:

1. **Wenger inherited an incredible back 5.** Wenger inherited a back 5 of Seaman, Dixon, Winterburn, Adams and Keown (with Bould able to interchange). All of them played for England (albeit Winterburn and Bould only played a few games). Even as those players have left, Sol Campbell, Lauren and Ashley Cole all got to play with them, learn from them and get integrated into a stable defence. Over time, it became clear that Wenger struggled to recruit and develop defensive players. I believe Arsenal still have a soft spine due to this even today. As a separate point: I think Wenger really planned on Ramsey and Wilshere having run that Arsenal midfield for a decade, which they may have if it hadn't have been for significant injuries at key points in their development.
2. **There's been a lack of investment into the club since Kroenke joined the club.** I've looked at the money spent before and after Kroenke buying the club and there definitely was a downturn in spending. Don't get me wrong, much of this previous spending was poorly done, but the change of ownership seems to be the catalyst. Some might say that the change of stadium was a reason for this, but nothing has changed even after that period.
3. **Scouting has been very questionable and with no real plan.** There have been some good players signed in recent years: Martinelli, Tierney, etc. There's also been a lot of horrendous signings: Mustafi (*£35m),* Perez (£17m), Kolasinac (£0m), Mavrpanos (£1.8m),  Mkhitaryan (swap deal), Lichtsteiner (£0m), Papastathopoulos (£14.4m), Torreira (£27m), Guendouzi (£8m) since 2016. Many of these players didn't seem to fit into the Arsenal team from day 1 of being signed. To add to that, Cedric Soares, David Luis and Willian are all clients of Kia Joorabchian. Soares played 5 times (mostly off the bench) in the season he was brought in on loan, despite a need for backup in the fullback positions. He wasn't Southampton's first choice the last few seasons towards the end of his time there, and were trying to shop him around.  Somehow, he was given a 4 year deal. David Luiz and Willian have been given lucrative deals despite their age. Willian was given a £200K 3 year contract having turned 32. David Luiz had his contract renewed having turned 33 and despite countless poor performances last season. That seems dodgy to me. Key scouts leaving due to Covid cutbacks hasn't helped.
4. **There was a huge power power vacuum when Wenger left.** It's well documented that Wenger did EVERYTHING towards the end of his time with Arsenal (recruitment, coaching, director of football etc). I think him leaving has left a giant power vacuum and changed the politics within the company. Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi leaving abruptly is a sign of that. It definitely wasn't helped by Ivan Gazidis, who seemed to do the bidding of Kroenke.

These points are big picture takes that I have. I think looking in the short - term, I believe that Mikel Arteta should be given more time. If you hire a manager with zero experience in a league with Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho, Brendan Rodgers and Carlo Ancelotti, it has to be because you believe he has the right philosophy and traits to be successful. He's needed to learn on the job during a condenced and unusual season. I think he needs at least one full season and to see if he progress is being made and in fact, I would give him until the end of NEXT season.

Without Auba's goals, Arsenal would've been in a similar position to where they are now at any time in the last few seasons. Now that they've dried up (and to be clear, I'm not having a go at Auba for that - he's been amazing for 2.5 seasons and I haven't seen anyone step up to support him during his poor form), it's exposed what many Arsenal fans have told me previous that they're a very poor team without his goals.

Just to be clear, I don't know whether Arteta is the real deal yet. I've seen some good signs, but I he's not been consistent. I think getting rid of him so quickly won't serve Arsenal and only throw more instability in addition to the above issues.",Arsenal from a (relatively) neutral point of view

A coach that doesn't celebrate a goal passionately or doesn't react angrily when something doesn't go his way might not be entertaining to watch so the business side of football dictates that he needs to do those things to satisfy the fans or else he isn't suitable to be managing.

The Premier League is a global brand that is a lot about image and impression. It needs entertaining, passionate and rowdy managers, not just those who are brilliant in tactics and could command a team.

I think this is the reason why Lampard, being a new coach, decided to try and establish his tough guy image (by beefing with other managers like Klopp). He knew the intense chemistry between SAF, Rafa, Arsene, Jose etc, needed to be replicated by his era, his own batch of Premier League managers.

He's become a bit of a meme so far this season, and he definitely should be doing better, but a goal contribution every 129 minutes in all comps isn't bad for how ""poor"" he has been. For comparison, Mane is at every 122 minutes. And I'm sure I'll get arguments that Mane contributes when he doesn't score as well but Martial ties United's attack together, his contribution outside of goals is actually very underrated. Just look at their with/without record.

"I'm sorry but Arteta gets way too much excuses regarding him having a bad team and I think it's a load of bollocks. Arsenal's team is nowhere near as bad as Arteta's tactics is making them out to look. They have a ok defense. Tierney and Gabriel are very talented players. Along with Bellerin, Luiz and Leno and that is not a bad defense at all. Up front they've got players like Aubameyang, Pepe, Willian and Saka. Midfield is probably the weakest part of their team but you've still got Partey. I don't see why on earth Arsenal have to play this absolutely dross football that Arteta is forcing upon them. Is this team so bad that they can't muster an open play goal in 7 hours of football. Are they that bad that they can only win 1 out of their last 5 games.Let's be real. Arsenal has easily the 6th best team in the Premier League. They have a better team than Leicester, Wolves, Southampton, Aston Villa. And yet Arteta is having them play like a Championship side. And what has all that defensive football got them? 4 losses in the league and 10 goals conceded is hardly anything to write home about.

Lampard proved last season that you can get something out of a team even if the defense is very weak. I think last season Chelsea and Arsenal this season have about an equal level of talent. Yet compare how Arsenal are playing and how Chelsea played. Arteta has got it completely backwards. People gave him a lot of slack after he won the FA Cup. But the truth is an FA Cup doesn't prove that you are a good manager. A lot of times a inept manager can make a team look much worse than they actually are, in the same way that a good manager can make a team look better than they are. Last season Kovac said Bayern players cannot play high pressing football. He got sacked, a good manager came in named Hansi Flick and lo and behold Bayern suddenly becomes the best pressing team in the world. This is a textbook example of a bad manager who is making his team look worse than they are due to his incompetence and lack of trust in his players. It's no different with Arteta.",Arsenal having a bad team is a myth

Yet city have failed to keep a track of their players who are getting payed hundreds of thousand of pound just to follow the bloody rules. Where the rest of the country are struggling to put food on the table and now have to stay locked down in the homes. Not mansions with acres of land to run around in. The premier league are also putting in millions to ensure everyone is tested regularly and to ensure that football can keep playing to the rest of us normal folk can have a little enjoyment of having the football on while we are stuck inside. 

A fine is not good enough. If players cannot take responsibility then they should be punished with a ban and the club has either to forfeit the game or field a weakened side. It has to black and white otherwise these players will continue to disrupt the game snd act they are invincible. 

This game has to go ahead tonight and it’s the same for any other future games where this instance takes place.

"So Reguillon (and Lamela, Lanzini and Lo Celso) all broke the lockdown rules by having a party on Christmas Day). Now just approx 2 weeks later Reguillon has assisted the possibly winning goal in the EFL Cup SF. For doing something illegal he has been fined by Spurs but nothing else has happened.

Given how Cavani was fined £100,000 and banned for 3 games because he said one word that was deemed inappropriate, why is it that a group of players can break the UK and the biggest punishment they face is a fine that is likely what they earn in a week or even less.

Surely a 3, 5 or even 10 match ban would be suitable for breaking COVID rules otherwise loads of players will continue to do it and potentially stop the pl because they could be spreading COVID to all teams.

Edit: I didn’t account on getting this many replies so I’ll address the main points that people are saying:

-I completely forgot about Walker and obviously the same principle should be applied to him.

-I thought that it was bad on behalf of the FA before the match for letting Reguillon with no punishment (aside from one issued by Spurs) and I made this post after he assisted a goal because I saw the irony in this.

"Last I checked defence is part of football. And a highly under appreciated discipline. You cant expect every team to turn in a highly aggressive attacking football against every team, especially with the way the schedule is. Look at Leeds. All I hear, even when they lose 3-0, is that they’re fun to watch. But at what cost? I highly doubt any Leeds fans actually enjoying their play week in week out when they lose to teams despite playing beautifully. Sometimes you gotta adapt and sit back to get the three points that you need. Which is what Southampton did. Which is what Spurs have been doing. And perhaps more teams should be doing so as to adapt to the tight schedule.

"In the season so far, the off-side calls made by VAR have been the topic of many discussions because it has determined the outcome of many games. 
Adding to this, I have a question:
They spend a lot of effort (drawing perpendicular lines, zooming in, and looking at different camera angles) to see if a person is behind or in front of a defender, but it seems as though they don't spend the same amount of effort to determine WHEN the ball is kicked. When, exactly, is the balled considered as being kicked? 

I suppose it is the moment the ball leaves the kicker's foot? But shouldn't they spend the same amount of effort to find this exact moment and then freeze the frame and move to where the person is on-side or off-side? To me, this moment is just as important as the millimeters they look at at goalside.",VAR: The ball leaving the foot
"So I've spent most of this season so far looking at ways to quantify how much teams have improved/worsened since last season as a way of analysing performance. I had gotten very tired with the general approach of saying ""x team had this many points at this stage last season!"" because that doesn't factor in any way, the order that the fixtures have come in. For example, West Ham started this season with an incredibly difficult run of fixtures and that should have been reflected in any comparisons to performance from last season early on.

Anyhow, this is what I've arrived at thus far. 

https://preview.redd.it/58gs9tcrxj961.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e472e4a5cc6765cba6eee1c44c19f22a77cbfe

The algorithm for deciding the final number takes in a lot of different factors ranging from performance, outcome and result data points. I'm always updating it so the table is often being rebalanced but those changes are usually incredibly subtle and affect the final numbers by small amounts.

"1. Liverpool: Become first back to backside to win the title since Man city did with 17/18 to 18/19 while doing without arguably their best player which is just incredible thinking about it 
2. Manchester United: Wins their first title since 2013 and Burno Fernandes shoots up to become a top 8 player on the planet and the best midfielder in the world while Rashford boost up to the top 30 and Ole gets in the top half of mangers in Europe by far and properly this would be their first title win that is totally unexpected from the start
3. Leicester City: It's been five years since their last title win in 2016 which is the greatest achievement in football history winning the premier league in the fashion that they did. but if they do it again then I feel like it would more impressive considering the fact that the quality of the league and the parity feels so much higher then a couple of years ago and Jamie Vardy legacy right now would be one of the most unique in football history considering winning two titles with two totally different styles with two totally different mangers and supporting casts as while his current ranking would shoot up to top 20 to top 15 in the world and a definite top ten striker in the world
4. Tottenham: This feel like a once in a lifetime opptumuinty to win a title in such a wide-open race as Harry Kane has been on another planet lately as Son has become his robin to his batman as he tries to break the assist record for most in premier league history and try to win a golden boot as well. if they win a title then Jose Mourihino's legacy just becomes that much better considering the rock bottom point that he had with Manchester United at the end of 2018. Harry Kane winning his first major trophy would make him a top 5 player in the world without a doubt and the conversation between Kane vs Lewy become a lot tighter than a lot of people think while Son becomes a top 15 player in the world. 
5. Manchester City: I'm not going to lie to you that this man city is a lot more pragmatic than another season by a pretty big margin because pep had to sure up the woeful defense of last year with a lot more rigid and old school approach which got them off to a very slow start which hit rock bottom this season with shocking 5-2 loss at home against Leicester City, but picked back up to this point where they had their best performances by far versus Chelsea which in the first half ripped them into shreds in under 40 mins scoring three goals which 6 or 7 honestly which tells me that they ready to sneak up on Liverpool or whoever at the top in the new few weeks and take their spot through the more defensive-minded approach which scores far fewer goals, but could potentially be the reason that they win their third title in 5 years which for pep will further cement his legacies as a top ten coach of all time period despite all of the money that he has spent and Kevin De Bryune will ended be remember as a premier league legend and the best midfielder of last 5-10 years. 

This season has been so many wild highs and lows that whatever I am saying right now could be null and void in a couple of weeks time and who knows whoever wins this title will be remembered for a very long time as properly one of if not the craziest title races of all time of all of football recent history by far and honestly as a Chelsea fan who properly out of races seeing current results lately go bad, I am just crazy ride ahead honestly",What does a Premier League title do for each of the top 5 teams for their legacies as a whole?
"1. In 2004, Porto was the only champion outside of the four major leagues in the new century. The stars in the array were Deco, Carvalho, and coach Mourinho.

2. In 2005, Liverpool, who was struggling in the Premier League very hard, had a mediocre lineup (I just left Irving, Torres did not come). The stars with a small median are Gerrard and Alonso who have not fully grown up.

3. In 2007, AC Milan, Sheva left, the main lineup is too old, and already has the prototype of Milan nursing home (Inzaghi, Maldini, Dida, Cafu, Gattuso, Seedorf are not young), but The opened Super Kaka saved the Milan pension team, head coach Ancelotti

4. In 2012, Chelsea, Mourinho's team's final peak and craziness, (Lampard, Terry, Drogba, Cech, Essien, the central axis is very old), Torres is in no state, the beginning of the season Boas messed up the Chelsea locker room even more.

Cheers!",This table is looking pretty awesome this season...
"A lot of people including me will say yes to this question. Henderson and Fabinho are playing as their CB's and they are missing the flair in the midfield. Who would they sign

SAMUEL GIGOT
Samuel Gigot is a French CB from Spartak Moscow who is 6'3"" and 27 years of age. Spartak are 3rd after 19 games (10/5/4) with 21 goals conceded which is 1.10 goals conceded per game. Gigot has also popped up with 3 goals in the Russian League and could be a half decent mid-term signing. Liverpool have also conceded 21 goals this season but in 2 less games which is 1.23 goals conceded per game. Based off stats, Gigot would be a great addition

JEROME BOATENG
Jerome Boateng is a signing that is much more money than  Samuel Gigot but is a much better player. The German may be in his Late 20's and Early 30's but is one of the most decorated footballers in the history of the game. 2 UCLs, 2 Super Cups, 2 Club World Cups, 8 Bundesligas, 5 German Cups and the World Cup, he's won everything in Germany but can he win anything in England?",Should Liverpool sign a new CB

"**Arsenal: David Alaba**. This might be a bit unrealistic, but Alaba is most likely leaving Bayern. If Arsenal can beat Real and others to the player, he would massively improve Arsenal in the form of a center back and being great cover in defensive midfield and at left back, with Tierney and Ceballos both massively underperforming this season, although Tierney has had a few decent games recently. Another option might be Maximillian Arnold, a great midfielder with the capabilities to execute Arteta's vision

**Aston Villa: Jack Harrison**. I hate this fact because I'm a Leeds fan, but a front line consisting of Harrison, Watkins, and Grealish would be arguably the best front 3 outside of the big 6. Harrison is a quality playmaker who can bring what Ross Barkley doesn't bring, and therefore push Aston Villa to do better.

**Brighton: Joao Moutinho**. Brighton right now are a team that, under the right leadership, could actually surprise a few people. A decent defense, decent attack, but a midfield which could use a lot of reinforcement. It's not like Potter doesn't have them playing good football, for example Tariq Lamptey's goal against Spurs (which should not have stood), but Adam Lallana isn't the best creative base for a team gunning for mid table security. Moutinho might not have age on his side, but he's definitely a player that can improve Brighton. A little work on patching up the defense would be useful as well, although that's more a tactical problem than a technical one.

**Burnley: Eddie Howe**. For an actual suggestion though, **Josh King** would add some much needed pace and tooth into a very poor attacking team. Still won't change anything if Dyche tries to make Dwight McNeil dribble the ball from his penalty area to the midfield line then boot it forwards to the attack, but Burnley fans can pray,

**Chelsea: Raphaël Guerreiro**. In my post a few days ago, I preached the importance of not signing big name players who only are that big because they scored 2 penalties and a tap-in to bring their team to the UCL quarter finals before a ""tragic"" 6-1 aggregate loss to Bayern where the player didn't even touch the ball once. Guerreiro actually has talent, something rare in a signing worth over 10m in the EPL. He's proven his abilities at Dortmund, and with Chillwell flopping, he's an escape route. Right now, I'm not sure he's the best signing. Try out Chillwell, and if not him then Marcos Alonso. But if Chillwell is a certifiable flop, Guerreiro is a talent proven by years of hard work at a big club.

**Crystal Palace: Divock Origi**. Any striker worth more than 5m would be a lifesaver for this club. Wilfried Zaha and Eze are being drowned by the lack of playmakers and strikers around them, or at least quality ones. Luka Milojevic works decently in the midfield, Guaita at the back, but you need 2 strikers to run a 4-4-2 system, and I'm only seeing one. Origi isn't the worst striker, although definitely overhyped by Liverpool fans, so why not him? Other options are Salomon Rondon, Arkadiusz Milik, and Jamie Tartt (don't look him up the show will probably make any proper englishman want to die but everybody else finds it nice).

**Everton: Christian Eriksen**. He's played terribly at Inter. He has absolutely no justification playing at a good team again. But Everton do need a decent deep lying playmaker to complement James, DCL, and Richarlison (amongst others). Eriksen is a definite outside option for it. He would definitely be a great player for Ancelotti to have and experiment with, and can change Everton for the better if he returns to his Spurs form.

**Fulham: Pablo Fornals**. Outside option, definitely. But if Fulham can get him, he would inject the midfield with some quality. Lookman isn't the best in the world at penalties, Mitrovic hasn't been clinical, but the midfield is arguably the absolute worst in the Premier League. Fornals would be a realistic, cheap option who could actually help them.

**Leeds United: Igor Zubeldia**. I didn't want to be unoriginal and just say Puig, so I went with Zubeldia.  He's not necessarily a replacement for Phillips or a center back, more as a player who can play anywhere in that region to compensate for the insane amount of injuries they've been picking up.

**Leicester City: Troy Parrot**. Spurs will be reluctant to let him up, but there's no question that Vardy's getting older. That isn't to say Vardy is no longer Premier League quality: I would still call him top 10 strikers in the league if not top 5. However, it isn't wise to rest your hopes on a 33 year old. My suggestion is to sign Parrot and maybe another more proven striker and develop them while Vardy can still work as their first choice to have a good backup in good time.

**Liverpool: Dayot Upamecano**. Good center back to cover for the injuries. If not a purchase then a loan with option to buy. Pretty simple.

**Man City: Kingsley Coman**. Goals needed. Goalscorer of UCL winning goal and treble winner. Outside shot, could become excellent under Pep. If he doesn't instantly take to the EPL though expect many ""flop"" messages.

**Man United: James Justin**. The easy choice for this would be a Pogba replacement. However, I personally think Donny van de Beek is the best option to replace him. James Justin is an outside shot for the left back position, which definitely needs reinforcement with Luke Shaw being the only/best option there. Brandon Williams is nothing compared to Justin, who's had a decent season at Leicester.

**Newcastle United: Ben White**. If Ashley actually opens his wallet for the first time in millenia (barring last summer), Ben White could reinforce the back line at Newcastle to push them even further from the relegation zone. Could cost them upwards of 30m, so a cheaper option may be needed

**Sheffield United: Juan Mata**. This would be a desperate signing without a doubt, but it might actually work. If Wilder can stomach changing to a new system and allowing Mata to be their main playmaker, it might not leave them last. Not saying they would survive, but Mata is a realistic signing who could provide some temporary relief or at the very least a win.

**Southampton: Sergio Romero**. Not to say that Southampton's goalkeepers are not EPL quality, but to be up at the top they need a stronger goalie. Romero doesn't instantly come to mind, but the stats back him to be the best backup goalie in practically the world.

**Spurs: Julian Weigl**. He is the perfect Mourinho player. He can work in the midfield or at the back, young but old enough to be in his prime, and would be perfect cover at Spurs for Alderweireld and Hojberg. 

**West Brom: Olivier Giroud**. Unlikely. But West Brom need a good striker desperately and Lampard's delusions about Tammy at striker and Werner at the wing means it could actually be done. Goals are needed and he can provide them.

**West Ham: John Brooks**. Not particularly great, but a good center back to keep West Ham from conceding goals, which would be much appreciated considering their lack of effective center backs.

**Wolves: Thilo Kehrer**. Seeing Kilman at CB is great considering my widespread condemnation of it (youth talents getting efficient game time) not happening enough, but it also means it's the easiest spot for me to improve so I'm going to be a hypocrite just this once and any other time I see fit. Thilo Kehrer has flown under the radar of impressive young talents, not seeming out of place at one of the biggest teams in Europe. Kilman could definitely still develop and maybe even compete with Kehrer, but either way an improvement would be made.

Or is it the simple fact that your attack just forgot how to finish? Pep Guardiola isnt a puppet master. Hes not the one whos supposed to be scoring into an open net from 2 yards out (Im looking at you Raheem). And its not just that, you actually have City fans who want Pep out. Have they forgot all hes done for them? 100 point season, back to back prems, and fourmidables? 

You also got Mikel Arteta, he came in and instantly transformed Arsenals playstyle. They went on to beat some of the best teams and won 1 and a half trophy (yes, im talking about the community shield. cant count that as a full trophy). He started the season quite shit, but does form not exist for managers? Aubameyang has scored like 1 goal all season and you dont see Arsenal fans saying he should fuck off. Artetas doing good now as well. This was a problem with Unai Emery as well. He almost got them a top 4 finish, had that unbeaten run for a fair amount of time for Arsenal, took them to a Europa League final then the fans turned on him and he lost all his confidence. And his players turned on him as well. Its not gonna get better no shit.


I can go on for days about examples of managers this has happened to. I can give 3 examples of just Jose Mourinho. Hes one of the most decorated managers in football history for gods sake. Put some respect on his name before you go and replace him with Avram Grante",Why do fans turn on managers so fast?

"Ik I'm an Arsenal fan but mine would be:

Arteta Ole Lampard

&amp;#x200B;

Arteta first cuz he won 2 trophies in 8 months unlike the other two who have none. Arsenal was internally and morally chaotic when he first took charge as well. He also has the best H2H record amongst the two managers(vs Ole: 2 meetings WW.  vs Lampard: 4 meetings LDWW). Also for some extra icing, Arteta has a better win record against Klopp than anyone listed(4 meetings WWLW). That's pretty good for someone who only managed a team for 10 months(that's when Arteta last met Klopp) in his managerial career.

&amp;#x200B;

Ole second cuz although he doesn't have any silverware he is currently 2nd place in the prem, placing better than Arteta and Lampard currently. He also got United to 3rd last season with a masterclass signing of Bruno(what a player)

&amp;#x200B;

Lampard last place by a mile cuz his only decent achievement was reaching the FA cup final and finishing 4th last season in the league. He spent 250M to sit 8th. Arteta and Ole would most likely perform better if they got that sort of backing.

"Just seen the penalty United have been given against Villa and hear Gary Neville praising Paul Pogba for being clever for taking a fall once Douglas Luiz puts his arm on him and honestly it’s so infuriating to see football reduced to this. We see some fantastic players get praised for being clever and falling under minimal contact (and it’s all clubs there’s no bias here, we see it from Salah, Kane, Fernandes and Vardy on a consistent basis) and rather than see it being called out and criticised, pundits are now praising it and calling it intelligent play. 

I don’t think I would mind VAR if it actually resulted in these calls being ruled out, but I feel VAR with its constant replaying and zooming of minimal frames if anything gives more free kicks and penalties for any theatrics like this. Of course this isn’t a VAR issue, a rule change needs to be implemented to fix this and actually punish players for this (seriously what happened to booking players who dive?)",Can we stop praising players for being clever for taking a dive?

"For example, Werner. He scored 28 goals last season in a system built for him. You could see a large amount of his goals coming from his breakaway abilities. Meanwhile, Lampard has him playing as a left winger half the time. He doesn't have the same effect, even if he has the attributes for it. Havertz is being talked about being a flop as well, even though he's been injured half the time and not performed all too poorly in general. This has been happening for a while, with Morata and Keita and so many others at other teams. Just because you have one good season doesn't mean you have the best passing range in Europe. Just because you work well in one system in one league doesn't mean the same is true for another system in another league. People should stop complaining when a player isn't instantly the best at their team when they were hyping up their potential instead of their abilities. This has happened time and time again. 

Instead of signing your Havertzs and Werners and Moratas who have just had a great season under a different system, instead consider signing somebody like Mendy who has a proven track record outside of media attention. Somebody like Luuk de Jong could probably score 10+ EPL goals a season but he's not talked about because he hasn't played for a ""big team"" yet even though he has a Europa League title under his belt. Julian Weigl could probably act as a midfield pivot for any team outside of the biggest few, but he's not talked about because he didn't ""reach his potential"" at Dortmund. Wout Weghorst hasn't been talked about at all in footballing circles even though he's led his team by scoring 9 in 13 in the Bundesliga, and is now starting to see some transfer rumors to Spurs. Let me predict what his career will be like if he makes this move: He'll join them, be unable to break through the Kane-Son dynamic, be called a ""flop"" because he scored once in the 5 games he was provided since Troy Parrot received more attention than him, build his career back at the age of 30 in a different league or at a lower level team like Crystal Palace, and eventually will be known as ""that guy who flopped at Spurs"" even though his career was so much bigger than that.

Alli can do a job as a second striker. They had no choice but to defend for 90 minutes because the attack was so poor. If that was Dele Alli playing like that he'd have come off in the first half.

As soon as Ndombele went off they had no chance. He's the only one that could hold up a ball up there. What was the point of not playing him at all against Leicester when they actually needed him, for him to only play 60 minutes again tonight? And having both Hojbjerg and Winks sit even when in possession when they're playing 3 at the back as well is ridiculous. They were clearly missing an extra man going forward.

Another set piece/cross goal conceded as well. Make of that whatever you will.",It wasn't the defending that cost Spurs
"A lot of people think the best player in the league in Bruno but Grealish is just as talented if not more, he is better creatively than Bruno and is just as good as a player going forward, without Grealish, Villa would've went down last year and wouldn't have signed players like Watkins and Barkley, his loyalty to Villa prevents him from being viewed as Englands best player as he is not at a top 6 club",Jack Grealish is the best player in the league at the moment

"Who’ve been your signings of the season for PL clubs? In no particular order, mine go...

Gabriel (Arsenal) - Currently looks like Arsenal’s only competent defender, you’d shudder to imagine  where they’d be without him. 

Watkins (Villa) - Really great all around striker, strong, fast and a great finisher on the ground or in the air. Spearheads Villa’s attack better than Wesley or Samatta and looks a menace whenever he’s on the pitch. 

Torres (City) - Really young, great fee and looks like becoming a star already under Guardiola. 

Martinez (Villa) - Villa’s unsung hero this season and maybe the most consistent shot-stopper in the league behind Alisson, Martinez makes you wonder why Chelsea didn’t go for him over Mendy. 

Allan (Everton) - The perfect anchor to a midfield containing more attacking options and one of the best DMs in Europe for almost 5 years, all for less than €30m. Only nitpick is his age, but for such a low fee he still makes it in. 

Lookman (Fulham) - Has looked absolutely electric for Fulham this season. Seemed underwhelming as a loan deal, but at this rate Fulham and every club in England should be vying to get him out of Leipzig this Summer. Huge key pass and dribble numbers and bear in mind that he’s still only 23. 

Fofana (Leicester) - Huge fee but for a 19-year old I don’t think anyone could have expected him to slot straight in to a top-4 challenging defense. Really astute signing shows that Leicester have still got it when looking for incredibly talented youth. 

Jota (Liverpool) - 12 goals and 2 assists in under 1200 league/UCL/cup minutes. Liverpool are lucky they didn’t go for Ismaila Sarr instead. 

Thiago (Liverpool) - Not had much of a chance to show it yet, but the best midfielder in the world for €30m is an unreal bargain. 

Hojbjerg (Spurs) - Exactly what Spurs needed in the midfield. Hojbjerg adds some steel to a midfield commonly criticized for being soft, as well as a great range of passing and an assured touch when in possession. When you consider that the deal basically works out to €3m + Kyle Walker-Peters, it’s a slam dunk. 

Coufal (West Ham) - The second acquisition from Slavia Prague in as many windows, Coufal’s strength and defensive mettle makes you wonder what other bargains are there to be had outside of Europe’s top 5 leagues.

Thiago Silva (Chelsea) - Added in by popular demand and due to the fact I completely overlooked him, Silva has provided maturity and stability to a young Chelsea side for the low cost of his wages.",Signings of the Season

"I include realistically because while we would all love to sign Van Dijk Neuer Lewandowski Ronaldo and Ramos, that might be a bit of a stretch 😅

As a city fan, after watching most of our games this season, especially the last couple, it seems straightforward enough. We need someone who can finish chances with 100% consistency. Sterling Torres Mahrez Bernardo are all phenomenal players but in their instinct, as wingers who often assist, they can’t be called upon to finish chances as much as we need. As a result we throw away anywhere from 1-3 scoreable chances a game. 

I think the idea signing for us would be a clinical forward, perhaps someone like Martinez?

"I love Frank Lampard and he's my second favorite player of all time behind Didier Drogba. I have wanted him to succeed this whole time and still do. Nothing would make me happier than him succeeding as manager and Chelsea winning the league with him. However, as a lifelong Chelsea fan I will always put the success of my club first. Multiple players mentioned that they chose to come to Chelsea due to Frank Lampard being here (Werner, Havertz and even Haaland said something along those lines). I believe he did a great job last year making it to the FA Cup Final (we should have won that) and finishing in the Top 4 with a transfer ban. We spent 250+ million this summer on absolutely brilliant players (Werner = 2 most goal contributions in Bundesliga, Havertz = one of the most highly touted young players in the world, Ziyech = someone who should have come to the Prem long ago, Chilwell = a top left back in the Prem, Mendy = stop gap goalkeeper and Silva = aging but still top level CB). We came into this season knowing that the plan was to close the gap on Liverpool and Man City this season and have top 4 and trophy as a BARE MINIMUM. We started this season with Kepa in goal and struggled even though we were playing teams that should not cause us problems (outside of Liverpool of course). Me and other fans made excuses about Kepa's mistakes and injuries against West Brom, Southampton and Liverpool. We went on a 17 game unbeaten streak while performing well in Europe and everyone was gassed up and claiming we were realistic title challengers and potentially UCL winners. Meanwhile nobody realized that none of the teams we beat were in the top 10 of the league. Then we had a shocker against Everton and Wolves, which in my opinion exposed the weakness of Lampard's tactics. We consistently play Timo on the wing (he's not a fucking winger and sucks there.. it's plain for everyone to see), we haven't played Kai in the correct position all season (he's a 10) and we INSIST on crossing the ball when we play Tammy up top (who can't win a header for his life.. look at the Spurs, Krasnodar, Arsenal games). Lampard's substitutions also make absolutely no sense, we didn't bring on Giroud when he's not only on form but also all we're doing is crossing for example (34 crosses, he also had Timo, Tammy and Giroud all on the field at the same time in one game). He also played a 50% Reece James and Ben Chilwell who were injured when we have a proven albeit aging RB in Azpi (our club captain btw) and Emerson who played absolutely fine against West Ham. He brought on Jorginho who doesn't progress the ball and played poor against West Ham as well. We are 15 points behind where we were at this point last season as well. I could say much more if anyone else is curious but this is a novel at this point.",Lampard Out (except there are no top managers really available anymore): And this is why...

The title says it all really. Some of the decisions that VAR have made have been to microscopic. You want VAR to catch the mistakes that linesmen miss but what is the point of it if the calls being made are in the millimeters. IMO if the kind of measurement being made by VAR are so miniscule as to barely affect the reaction time of the players in any way then it shouldn't called. A tolerance limit should be set wherein if a player is off by a certain distance then he should be allowed the benefit of the doubt.,VAR should have a tolerance limit.

"Now, I know what you are thinking - just pick the best 18, right? Well, not necessarily. I can choose a heavily attacking side with Sterling, Mahrez, Salah, Rashford, Mane, Bruno, Son and Kane, but is this team realistically outscoring the opponent for 38 games? No, there needs to be some strategy into choosing the best all-around team. Plus, for the sake of it being more interesting, you gotta think about non-quantifiable factors like - who will be the big start, who will be pulling the strings in the midfield, are you gonna pick very offensive wing backs and if yes - maybe a CDM extra to cover the spaces behind them?   


Rules for participating:

* **Max 3 players per team -** the idea is not to pick Liverpool's team and add De Bryune and Maguire (haha)
* **Pick the formation you want -** 3-4-3, 4-4-2, anything you would like to play 
* **It's based on players right now, not their potential -** picking a team of the Lampteys, Curtis Joneses and Pedro Netos of the world would be fun but realistically they are not breaking the record 

No more rules - let's play! 

**Starting 11:**

1. **GK - Alisson -** Alisson wins us 15 points by himself, just making those 1 or 2 sensational saves per game that keep us in a game/save us a tight game. Very easy choice. 
2. **RB - Kyle Walker -** provides defensive stability, can play as the right CB in a back three and on offence can still produce, albeit not as much as Trent Alexander Arnold. Walker is the man for the right.
3. **CB - Conor Coady -** I will never not say that he is one of the best CBs in the league. In a back 4 they could be sensational.
4. **CB - Virgil Van Dijk -** I mean, when he's playing he is the best CB in the world. Remember, people were saying he was better than Messi. That's insane for a defender.
5. **LB - Ben Chilwell -** this season for Chelsea he was even better than last year, capable on the back and as dangerous as ever on the front.
6. **CDM - N'Golo Kante -** having infront of these 4 basically locks my defence. It's unplayable - Kante's there and then if you pass by him you face a wall. These defence alone is getting 27 to 30 clean sheets. 
7. **CM - Paul Pogba -** not only Kante locks the defence, but he unlocks Pogba. Example? Look no further than World Cup 2018 where Pogba and Kante played together and we all saw what happened. 
8. **CM - Kevin De Bryune -** basically have De Bryune be the more offensive midfielder out of the three.
9. **RW - Mohamed Salah -** for me Salah is the second best player in the Premier League and the best right wing in the world. Look at his numbers - since joining Liverpool probably only Messi and Lewa have more goals than him. 
10. **LW - Heung-Min Son -** what can I say - he is different. With these passers he gets three, four chances per game and with his ratio of goals/shots, that guarantees goals.
11. **ST - Jamie Vardy -** I know Harry Kane plays in the PL, but again, with this passing Vardy will get so many chances. He is also way better in a possession play than people think.

**Reserves:**

1. **Nick Pope -** so underrated. Nick Pope filling in for Alisson sounds like a dream.
2. **Thiago Silva -** the idea of Silva being on the bench is that he is quite old so I don't want him to play every game. Rotate the starting two, start every other game. When he plays he is always dominant. 
3. **Reece James -** perfect choice from the bench to give Walker some air. 
4. **Jack Grealish -** someone parked the bus against us, it's 75th minute and it's 0-0, what do we do? Easy, put Grealish in and he will find the gap in the opponent's defence.
5. **Raheem Sterling -** Son terrorized the opponent's right back in the first half, he is tired and has a yellow. And now he will defend against a well-rested Sterling for 45 minutes! Yikes.
6. **Harry Kane -** this bench is making me feel anxious for the other side. Kane from the bench? What?
7. **Wilfried Ndidi -** Kante will cover a lot for the attacking players and he needs to have a player coming off the bench to cover for him.

With this my side is finished. In a normal game you have De Bryune and Pogba pushing balls forward to the three speedsters and if the opponent parks the bus, you can put Grealish in to empty pockets, Sterling to make them uncomfortable and Harry Kane to annihilate.

"I'll be honest, I now try to avoid anything on twitter specifically, but also media response to Leeds matches as a whole. While it's nice to watch the praise for wins, some of the opinions and views of pundits, fans of other teams and even Leeds fans, just hurt my head. So I wanted to put my honest views on everything Leeds related, just to see what other Leeds fans think, if anyone agrees/disagrees, but also what other fans of other teams think.

To start with, in all honesty the expectation from the media for Leeds this season took me by surprise. Sure, we play exciting football, and having watched it for over 2 years it's become normal though I'm reminded watching other team's games how good the football is (don't get me wrong, losing is still losing and not a great feeling, but as for the quality of football and excitement when I watch, it's great), but that doesn't mean we'll be a team challenging for Europe like I saw at the start of the season.From all honest Leeds fans (because we all have those crazy fans), our aim is, and always has been the same as any promoted from Championship. Survival. I'm not in a dream world as to the relaity of what we should expect to achieve as a team. I would take a goal difference survival, a couple points survival, hell, even a goal line technology malfunction survival (Just a joke Villa fans, nothing serious). After 16 years out of the Prem, where it was looking more and more likely we'd be forever a Championship team, with the odd upset in playoffs/scare of relegation to League 1, I want nothing more than to just stay in the Premier League.

As for the love Bielsa gets, it's all based on his footballing impact, not accolades and trophies. He has a clear style of play, and he implements it at every club he goes to, win, lose or spanking (As we saw on Sunday). I think a lot of that admiration from people for him gets mixed for expecting him to be making Leeds a team challenging the top 6 (Or so it feels). People aren't followers of him or lovers of him because he wins trophies and tactically outclasses managers left right and centre, but for the exciting and clear style no matter the opponent, and how he is football mad in every way. He's an intriguing manager, which a strange personality and a pure passion for football as a game. Manchester United's starting 11 cost around £400m, and Leeds's cost around £70m. You'd never expect to win that game with any manager, so it's no surprise we lost. I wouldn't choose to lose heavy but it will happen with how we play, Bielsa's coaching and play style doesn't work miracles to overturn teams with starting lineups over 5x the price of ours (although some would argue our promotion seemed like a miracle for the majority of Leeds fans). But it does allow us to see our team actually compete with these teams and look like we can score just as easily as anyone, despite the clear weakness in our squad. That is what I admire.

&amp;#x200B;

Our performances in the league this season haven't been much different to teams in previous years who've stayed up, so I'm understandably happy with how we've played, even with some of the losses we've taken. We're doing well in relation to our avoid relegation target, and that is what I find important. But there's plenty of football to play, and many points to be won/lost, so I'm not naive to the possibility of relegation, anything can happen, but as things stand we're on track.

For me personally, I use watching Leeds now more than ever as an escape from the real world, from the upset of being in a tier 4 area over Christmas, and stresses of working in a critical worker sector right through all the lockdowns. This year has been hard for everyone, each of us with our own struggles and battles, but I'm glad football can continue, and I'm even happier knowing I can watch us play like we do. I don't think we're 'better' than any team because of it, morally or tactically. I just enjoy the viewing pleasure of how the players have bought into the exciting playstyle, and I'll make the most of it even if it results in relegation. I am and always be a Leeds fan, and regardless of the outcome of the season, I'll always appreciate that Bielsa has sparked my interest in Leeds to its maximum I've experienced (As a 20yr old fan whose only ever remembered/experienced doom and gloom), and given us hope that we can get back to being a 'big' team some day, even if that is many many years down the line.

Then 1 man down and even there is a clear handball in the box, it's harsh but with all the new stupid handball rules it is no less of a handball then the one liverpool got to draw the game against us.

"IMO they should introduce the concept of linesman call to VAR much like umpires call in cricket. The simple aim of VAR is to reduce obvious errors. Now, tight offside calls are not obvious errors. Its too difficult for a linesman to see whether a players armpit is offside in real time. For any offside call with the difference between the last player and the opposite teams player being less than x mm, it should be a linesman call i.e. whatever the linesman ruled in real time.

"They're still a few points clear of the relegation zone, but I don't think it's too early for fans to start panicking about his possibility.

This is a club that has the second-highest payroll in the league. It's phenomenally pathetic that they're not only out of the top half of the league but this close to suffering relegation. Makes it even worse when you have teams with not even half of Arsenal's payroll miles ahead in terms of performance.

Even if things do get somewhat better as the season wears on (which I'm doubtful of), I think Arsenal should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. But even that feels like asking too much of this dumpster fire of an organization. Even if Mikel Arteta is replaced, the problems run deeper than that. For example, Stan Kroenke is the most arrogant, greedy, and shameless POS out there (not to mention he supported Donald Trump, that should tell you enough about the man) and he's one of the biggest reasons, if not *the* biggest reason, this club has been run like a comedy show.

Watching the United game and I’ve just seen Dan James get booked for a ‘dive’ even though it was clearly not a dive. Yet players like coady get away scot free with his clear dive against Liverpool. Why is inconsistency like this still so rife at the top level?,‘Diving’ in the premier league and serious inconsistency?

"One of the most interesting things I've noticed with now fans in the stadium (apart from the performances and lack of home advantage) is the stadium wraps, or seat covers, whatever you want to call them. But who has the best?

For me, even as a Liverpool fan through and through, I have to nominate Manchester United.

First and foremost, the full stadium wrap with not just the first tier of seats being wrapped, but the whole stadium. That added with a majority of the stadium being filled with pictures of fans that cannot make the game, gives a personal and fan friendly customisation that no other club really gives. And then with the HATRED (with the HAT crossed out to just spell red) along with other ""United against racism"" wraps that coordinates with the fight against racism campaign is a touch of class.

Side note: Wolves is a close second place with the fan pics, making a collage of players and management team.",What team has the best stadium wraps?
"Glad the concussion sub rule is coming in, fine with staying at 3 subs, but it got me thinking about other things that could be changed.

I’d like to see diving be penalised retroactively. I know in the NBA the referees review every decision (or non-decision) after the game, so if the same is done with football matches it should be pretty easy to identify dives (successful or otherwise). I think if you start handing out 1-match suspensions, players will be much less likely to dive.

I’d also like to see the 6-second rule actually be applied. This is in part to quell time wasting late on, but also just to speed up the play. Keepers take 10-15 seconds almost every time, more when they’re winning late on and go to ground after making a straightforward catch...I’d kinda like to see the how actually adhering to the rule affects play.

Finally, another one that’s already a rule but not implemented, I’d like to see bookings (and thus stopping players from doing it) when they stop a quick fee kick or throw. Like players commit a foul then grab the ball, or they just stand in front of the ball and stuff. I dunno, I’d like to see the game run more smoothly.

I think Arnold is a typical player promoted by the team system. This is difficult to verify. Because he has been in Liverpool. However, for the national team, he is not the main player, and he has not had any good performances.

What is a team? It can help you make up for your weaknesses. His strengths and weaknesses are very obvious, his strengths are bold offense and imaginative passing. The downside is that his defense is really bad. Many people can sieve him if he doesn't help him. Moreover, his bold pass itself is a risk for the team to change the ball. He has a lot of assists, but also missed a lot of passes, at least a lot more than Robertson.

"In my honest opinion I think it's such a close call, it really should benefit the attacker therefor onside. The check was very quick, they saw it was close and let it go, brilliant in that sense. But, this has not been done before and it's clearly inconsistent with the nanometer-checks we've seen earlier where checking the offside takes well over 3 minutes.

I honestly hope they continue to check like they did with this one. But if they now go back to zooming, drawing and checking toe nails for offside like before, it will show just another sign of inconsistent VAR  usage.

At 5:25 in this video, John McGinn is fouled and a penalty awarded: [https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906](https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906)

In the video, you can clearly hear the sound of players colliding. Even as a Villa fan I thought there wasn't much contact at the time. I can completely imagine the ref using his ears as well as his eyes to make the decision. In this instance, it wasn't overturned.

However, there have been other penalty decisions overturned. Since lockdown, teams have mostly been playing in empty stadiums, where you can hear more of the action.

I wonder if referees are using their ears more to make decisions. Then, when reviewing the slowed-down footage (either at Stockley Park or pitchside), they no longer use that audio. From different angles, contact between two players can look better or worse.

My theory is that in some cases, referees see what looks like contact, and their ears confirm it for them. However, on review, and without audio, that's overturned.

If that is the case (and someone with access to stats could check it), then a lo-fi option would be to keep the audio during reviews (if they don't already). Sports like cricket use snick-o-meters to determine how much contact was made between bat and ball.

As crowds return the pitchside mics may pick up less, but keeping the audio could be a useful signal to officials trying to decide whether, and how much contact was made, especially when it's unclear from different camera angles.",Does lack of audio during reviews impact VAR decisions?
"Allegri is (to the best of my knowledge) available and Lucien Favre is also available after getting the sack at dortmund.

(edit) : I am not saying Arteta should get the sack, but the question is who should take over if he gets the sack regardless of weather or not he deserves to stay.","Assuming Mike Arteta gets the sack, who should take over as Arsenal manager?"
"I've seriously had enough. The players can't care less we have no fight no descipline no nothing. We have an overhyped manager who let's remember isnt even a club legend, hasn't got any managerial experience and no backing from the board. Aubameyang has scored the same amount of own goals this season then open play goals, let's remember Gabriel has the same amount of goals as him. Even fucking benteke is managing 2 goals so far. I've lost all the excitement all the I can't wait for the match. I've had to deal with this bs team for so long. I won't ever leave arsenal but my word wht is going on. Our fans are quite. Did u see the amount of noise Palace fans are making or Fulham fans. I really with sometimes I wish we could scream chants and hurrah us on.",I can't deal with arsenal anymore.
"The term sleepwalking towards disaster is well and truly applicable too Arsenal, from the days of consistently finishing 4th and gloating about it too now being an outright shambles, every step Arsenal have taken as a club has led them to this moment. From transfer strategy too management, everything is wrong structurally, and frankly with or without Mikel Arteta I think results wouldn’t be different. 

This is a problem that I believe could last up to a decade or beyond. I saw it with Liverpool (who probably started from a worse position in terms of squad and management before arriving too the brendan Rodgers and now loool era’s) and we can see it now with United where issues have remained permanently since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. 

The worst part is the Arsenal fans. Who have now reared there true ugly heads (IMO). They are completely spineless, this is just based on the differing reactions from Liverpool and United fans when there clubs had/have fallen into turmoil. One win gets blown out of proportion, and a loss is the end of there club. These run of results should act as a humbling, yes Arsenal are a “big club”, but I see no acceptance of the current situation. When Emery was in it was about getting rid of him to find a style and give an opportunity to the younger players, that was the Arteta plan. Now it’s again get rid of the manager, find a style and give a chance to the younger players. 

Xhaka has never been good enough, nor has elneny, mustafi or holding and get they consistently find themeselves with opportunities in the first team. Every player can play well for a short period of time but it’s inevitable that the flaws which hinder them from being truly elite players will rear themselves, which is perfectly fine, however Arsenal fans seem to disillusion themselves by a few good performances and then expect the good performance to become permanent. Which I revel in to be honest, got plenty of Arsenal mates and it’s good to see the chaos looool

"I know players looking for fouls is nothing new but this season it seems like it's happening constantly. Will be watching a game and it'll constantly be broken up by someone collapsing to the floor screaming cos they got poked and will win a foul or the ball will be kicked out to see if they're ok, even though they are completely fine and there was never enough enough contact for that.

I feel like players know especially with VAR that any contact no matter how minimal will result in a foul as long as they fall over, e.g. the Robertson foul on welbeck. Players have also stopped competing for aerial battles cos they know if the other player jumps they can get a foul by falling over and saying they jumped into them, Joe Roden did that like 3 or 4 times in the match against Chelsea. Idk if I'm just noticing it more but it definitely feels more common and its making games really shit to watch and there's no exciting physical battles.

Feel like there could be a rule where refs can determine if there was enough contact to warrant them falling over, would actually make the game interesting.",Is anyone else getting frustrated at how easily players are going down

"The top 6 matches in the PL are always hyped up for a  week and a lot of the time when it comes to the match it just turns into an absolute snore fest.

I mean you have Man Utd vs Chelsea and Chelsea vs Spurs which finished 0-0, you had Man Utd vs Arsenal which was 0-1 (but only from a penalty) and as I’m writing this it’s currently 0-0 in the Manchester derby with two big chances after 37 minutes.

At the moment all the top 6 teams are so scared of slipping up in one of the big matches and so they don’t do anything risky and the end result is just a boring match that usually finishes 0-0 with most of the possession in midfield and hardly any attacking play.

In all honesty the only ‘exciting’ top 6 game was Spurs (6) vs Man Utd (1) and even that was boring in the way that it was so one-sided.

The big PL matches now are the main reason why I find the mid table and low table PL matches and then championship matches so much more exciting.",Top 6 matches are so boring now

While United and Liverpool are rivals, I like watching United do well. Especially, in the Ferguson days, I felt like United could dig really deep for a result even when their players were having an off day - it kind of reminds of how Liverpool plays now. 

Ole is a strange one. Whenever I see him on the touch line or interviews, it seems as though he’s not in control of the team.  I’m finding it difficult to put it into words but it just seems different from his Cardiff days when it felt like he was in charge. When United are having an off day, I’ve not seen Ole really take charge. For a lack of a better word, Ole seems a little clueless. I’ve noticed this even when the team is playing well.

"Last season they were being tipped as outsiders for UCL at one point. Now they'll need a miracle to escape relegation. 11 games so far this season, only a singular point picked up. What has gone wrong?

An interesting point to start on is Sheffield's wage bill: Only Leeds United come close in how little is spent on player wages. They're currently around the $20m USD mark, upgrading $4-5m since last season. For reference, Mesut Özil's salary is about the same as the entire Sheffield United team. Phil Jagielka is their best paid player.

Tactically, Sheffield play a 5-at-the-back, with a formidable center 3 being key to their good results last season. However, this time around, injuries have hit hard. Jack O'Connell's statistics show how well Sheffield perform with and without him: Sheffield win 475% more games with him, get 3 times more points per game, and concede half the amount of goals. Attempts to move around players to fix this haven't worked: they lack physicality, awareness, and pure quality. It's easy to see just how hard this has affected Sheffield as a whole.

Up front as well, Lys Mousset's lack of performances has left Sheffield stranded. And no offense to everybody in Sheffield's attack, but they need to improve heavily if they want to survive this season. In winter, a striker needs to be signed who can finish goals. If Sheffield's defense can partially recover themselves, and the attack can be improved to get Sheffield playing at last season's level, perhaps they won't see themselves facing Championship teams next season",What's gone wrong at Sheffield United this season?

Lastly, what do you think is the biggest contributor to Arsenal performing so poorly?

I feel a managers duties are to put out the best side each and every performance while also maintaining so rest for players in big stretches. I also think they are there to motivate players and challenge them to grow in aspects of their game that need development. However, a manager can only do so much and as much as they want their to perform the best, they cant actually control how the team goes out and plays. I see a lot of Arsenal fans who want to blame Arteta for Arsenals performances and my question is just why do you think he's to blame? Is he not putting out the best lineup? Again, I feel its a bit harsh to throw all criticism at a manager because the players are the ones actually out their on the pitch and he cant control the fact that someone like Aubameyang hasn't scored a game time goal in however many matches its been.

"As another year soon comes to a close we see yet another year without the first openly gay Premier League player. This is not a problem most of us think about on a daily basis, but we really should.

Can you imagine? It's 2020 and gay footballers are still having to hide their true identities. Almost every other major industry has openly gay celebrities and influencers. Why is football (and sport in general) lagging so much behind?

My first thoughts were along the lines of players being afraid of their teammates' reactions. That they'd be afraid they might not be wanted in the locker room anymore because they shower together and so forth. Then I learned that [a number of gay players have come out to their teammates but not to the outside world](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/26/20-footballers-have-told-me-theyre-gay-says-top-football-boss/). Naturally, that is not to say that it doesn't play a role. The fear comes from a number of different factors and it differs between players. One huge factor is undoubtedly the reactions of us, the fans.

The problem of coming out was emphasized by an unnamed gay player of the Premier League [in an open letter](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/read-gay-premier-league-stars-22338520) earlier this year where he says: ""Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare. And it is affecting my mental health more and more. I feel trapped and my fear is that disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse"". Furthermore, he states that ""I just don’t think football is ready yet for a player to come out"". I recommend you read the full letter, and to the player behind it, whoever you are, thank you for speaking out.

I think it is time that we as fans show the stars we all know and love that their sexuality does not affect our opinion of them. We need to make them feel welcome. We need to show them that football is ready for players to be themselves.

Will every single fan be supportive? Unfortunately, no. However, I firmly believe that a large majority of fans will be supportive and drown out the voices of the few.

Understandably, it is very hard to be the first player to come out of the closet. However, as we have seen in the past, these things become easier for each person following the last. Hopefully, we will see the first openly gay Premier League player soon. And the second. And the third. Until suddenly we will be shaking our heads that this was ever a problem in the first place.

To all the gay footballers in the Premier League (or elsewhere), if you ever read this, I want to say the following:

&gt;I support you and welcome your sexuality. I don't want you to live your life hiding who you are. I don't want you to have to live your golden years in mental agony. I want you to feel safe, loved, and supported as the person you truly are, because you deserve it. I understand that you might not feel ready to come out and I respect that, but if you are, know that I am ready for you.

If football is ever going to be ready, we need to show both our current and future gay stars that we care. Many of our favorite activities might be closed due to the pandemic, but we can show our beloved players that football is **open** for gays. #FootballIsOpenForGays

1. Surely the best way to play is the way that wins you games instead of trying to play into the opponents’ hands.

2. Why do they feel like they know better than the best manager of the last 15 years

3. Spurs players haven’t won a trophy and if a man comes in that has won everything in his career and tells you that you can win by doing it this way, surely you won’t have a problem with following his instructions.

"What happened to that club? I'm a Chelsea fan, so there's obviously a part of me that enjoys their misery. That said, I'm pretty shocked at how the fortunes have reversed. 

I remember 5 years ago, Chelsea was a midtable club that was in danger of being relegated for a part of the season while Arsenal was playing attacking football with Alexis Sanchez, Ozil, and Giroud leading the charge. They also were doing good business by developing the young talent and then buying from the outside at great prices to fill in the gaps/keep the squad competitive. I think they also had managed all or most of their stadium debt, so it seemed like the future was bright. They had the combination of good youth players, world class talent (Sanchez/Ozil at that time), and a self-sustaining model.

Now, look at them. They've spent almost as much as Chelsea, but have made horrible transfer purchases (Pepe), haven't gotten any results from their stars after handing them fat contracts (Ozil and Aubameyang thus far), and don't seem to be producing any Jack Wilshere or Theo Walcott type of talents from their academy anymore.

What led to quick and sudden decline? After missing champions league once, it seems they completely fell off, despite a supposedly self-sustaining model. They are also now well behind their rivals and will likely be handicapped financially due to the pandemic and no Champions League football in the near future.","Seriously, What Happened to Arsenal?"

In the Arsenal vs Wolves match last week, Luiz came charging in for a header and collided with Jimenez in the box as he cleared the ball from a corner. I have heard a few people claiming Luiz came in recklessly however I think I agree with the majority here saying it’s a 50:50 ball with both players trying to help their team. Both players were grounded, with Luiz having a significant gash on the head which causes frequent bleeding during the match, and Jimenez actually being knocked unconscious as a result of the collision. It was reported Jimenez was out of it for around 10 minutes before regaining consciousness.

**Transcript:**

When you see 2 players collide like this, very similarly to the Bailly Maguire incident for United last year in the Fa Cup semi-final vs Chelsea, the 1st thing that comes to mind is potential concussions. The Fa and Premier League have been called out by pundits multiple times over the last few years particularly around this subject saying players do not have enough protection from these injuries and teams should be allowed to have temporary concussion substitutes. From a health standpoint I really like this recommendation because it removes the pressure on a manager to keep a player on in fear of using up an unnecessary sub and gives the injured player the most ample chance to recover and be assessed in that short amount of time.

Recently in the last few years the Fa introduced a concussion protocol for teams to follow depending on the league they are in. Regardless of who you play for, if a player (in this case Luiz and Jimenez) suffers a head injury the 1st thing you need to do as the healthcare professional is DR ABC (Danger, Response, Airways, Breathing and Cardiovascular) and assess for evidence of a concussion. A concussion is a term thrown around a lot in the media, but what does it actually mean in a medical context. A concussion ‘medically’ refers to a mild traumatic brain injury often caused by a bump or significant knock to the head which causes the brain to hit the inside of the skull. This can also occur when a person experiences whiplash.

When you have a player that has been involved in a head collision or injury, at first we are going to assess them and find out if they are showing any symptoms of concussion like dizziness &amp; headache. However in addition to asking them if they are experiencing any of these, something is to consider is players may not be telling the truth because they want to play particularly in situations where they are in the last year of their contract or fighting for a spot in the 1st team. So to control for this, we would ask a few questions testing for memory disturbance such as

1. What venue are you at today?
2. What half is it now?
3. Who scored last in the game?
4. Did you team win the last game?

Any incorrectly answered question may indicate that potentially a player is suffering from concussion however bear in mind someone with a brain injury may still be able to answer these correctly. In that very short time, the clinician has to make a decision whether they think a player has suffered a concussion or brain injury, which can be an extreme burden if a team is chasing a game and the star gets injured or big games are coming up. However, as the clinician you must isolate yourself from the surroundings and decide what is best for the player and only the player. If any potential signs of concussion arise, there is only 1 option. Take them to hospital for full and detailed health checks looking for possibility of brain injuries. Personally I have only been involved in 2 concussion checks live in a football match and both instances the player was ok and allowed to continue.

With David Luiz we can assume there were no signs of a concussion as he was able to play on by the Arsenal Medical team, however the big contention was surrounding why he was allowed to continue if blood was dripping down and if he was just not showing signs of injury. This is where the debate comes in, as the current rules say players who pass the concussion protocol test can continue to play and gashes as long as they can be controlled are minor occurrences as we have seen in Premier League history with many players wearing bandages around their heads during matches.

For regular concussion protocol players at the highest level of football with access to the best immediate treatment are scheduled to return after 1 week (6 days to be precise) and 12 days if 17-19. In grassroots football, this extends to 2-3 weeks depending on symptoms and if players are assessed as fit to return by healthcare staff at the respective clubs.

With Jimenez’s injury, things get more difficult because it has been reported he suffered a skull fracture as a result of the collision with Luiz. 2 Players I know off have suffered these injuries in the past, Petr Cech most famously who was able to return to play after a period out and become a Chelsea legend. Secondly. Ryan Mason who’s career was unfortunately ended as a result of the injury. From a medical standpoint, I am not too worried about the actual fracture as breaks in bones can always be fixed, reattached or connected using a metal plate (see full video for image of fixed skull). The more concerning matter at hand is the traumatic brain injury experienced however it will be interesting to see if Jimenez’s heading ability is affected by the injury or if his skull is more susceptible if something similar happens again.

“A skull fracture is one thing, the other more serious issues tend to be what’s going on with the underlying tissues,” says Dr Michael Grey, of the University of East Anglia. “Recovery wise, the fracture itself is less of an issue. The bones will repair themselves. They’ll start to fuse within two to three weeks, and it will be more or less solid again in six weeks.”

Yes the bones have to heal, but the real challenge I feel will be the making sure there are no neurological defects that may arise in the short term or potentially manifest itself later on in the future. **So, when will Jimenez return, based on all the information not a for a while is the best answer**. Even though its vague if we look at what Dr Grey said the skull alone with take around 6 weeks, but the time out is truly dependent on neurological symptoms. **If Jimenez shows any signs of degeneration neurologically this could end up very sadly for him with a potential career end but let’s all hope that doesn’t happen and he is able to return safe and healthy when the time is right**.

"**Yes I am a Chelsea fan but I truly believe the points I make are unbiased facts.** 

So I just think that Lampard is doing really well with Chelsea, has shown signs of being a great tactician, adaptable to situations, not just a one trick pony and can win things with Chelsea.   
Since he has come in I have heard comparisons to him and Arteta saying ""Arteta worked under Pep he will show up Frank"" and ""Frank took Derby from 6th to 6th and took Chelsea from 3rd to 4th""  


I don't think people understand that to take a team into a Championship play off final in your FIRST EVER year as a manager is not a bad achievement. Also taking charge of a Chelsea side having gotten a transfer ban, brought in tonnes of youth players, lost their best player (Hazard) while other teams signed and improved.   


I also think that although last season they dropped lots of points to games they should have won due to individual errors, they performed great, have a really attractive style, have a go at teams. We played Liverpool 4 times last year, and in all of them games we were arguably the better team (maybe not in the 5-3) and would have won had we been more clinical.   


This season since Mendy and Silva have been regularly starting we have conceded like 4 goals in all comps, only lost to Liverpool (with 10 men for the second half, kepa giving away a goal and missing a penalty) and we have dropped points to WBA (due to alonso) and Southampton (due to kepa).   


Yes people can say we have spent loads and it should be expected, but the foundations for the style of play already existed last season. So to recap, Lampard is a great manager and is levels ahead of Ole and Arteta.",Lampard not getting enough credit and putting an end to the Arteta comparison.

"Hey all, another dumb American trying to get advice on what team to support here!

Some background, I am a huge sports fan and sports card collector that is trying to expand my watching and collecting horizons. I have typically only paid attention to baseball and American Football, but I recently have found myself wanting to watch and collect other sports as well. I have always loved baseball the most since I have a team I am dedicated to (go Yankees!), so I was wanting to get that same experience as I begin to watch Premier League matches.

After doing some browsing the common consensus seems to be to watch some matches and see who stands out to me, but for some reason that seems a bit impersonal to me. I am a Yankees fan because my family used to live in New York for generations, and I want that more personal connection to the team I support. This brought me to the idea of using Ancestry to figure out where my English ancestors were from. After a bit of digging I discovered that my 9th great-grandfather was born in Manchester before coming to the colonies in the early 1700's.

That helped me decide that I wanted to support a team from Manchester, but I know absolutely nothing about the differences between Manchester City and Manchester United. I was hoping to get a bit of help breaking down the clubs, their history, their fans, etc. between those two clubs so I can make a bit of a more informed decision before I start watching the matches more regularly. I have read a few things about each club, but since I don't have much background on the history of the league I was hoping to get more info on how the the clubs are perceived by those of you here. If any of you are fans of American Football or baseball as well and can make comparisons to teams from those sports as well that would be very helpful.

It's not an area of the game that I've ever put too much thought into - aside from admiring the odd long-throw taker and getting frustrated when I see no movement.

He talks about being met with a lot of scepticism over the course of his career, what do you all think about this level of specialisation?

The stats that he cites in terms of his impact at Liverpool are pretty impressive.

"I am an Arsenal fan and I posted the below in the Arsenal community and got a mixed review, I would love to know what is the general consensus and if in your comments you could state the team you support, for reference.... 

  
For me personally, league-wide, VAR has to stay but has to be used in the correct way, think back to before VAR and how many goals were disallowed for offside when the player was onside, or how many goals were given even though the linesmen got it wrong and they were, in fact, offside or even fouls that when you watch the replay should be an absolute stonewall red card and sometimes aren't even given a yellow for.

Imagine the Auba goal against man utd last year when he was clearly about a yard onside and the linesman got it wrong, went to VAR, and got given.... but this season the officiating quality has just slowly declined and declined, no other league has these issues and officials from other countries constantly get selected over British referees for champions league finals and European and world cup goams, why? because the referees here stink, there needs to be a substantial investment into the training of referees in this country.

  
It's not even just about the offsides and drawing lines incorrectly and taking 3 minutes to come to a decision, there should be more reviews on shirt pulling the in the box for a corner as I'm seeing it weekly now across different games that defenders are pulling the back of the attacker's shirts and there's never a penalty for this...?

"With all the controversial VAR decisions this season, lots of players voiced their dissatisfaction and confusion with the unclear rules and the inconsistency of VAR. 
Also referees seem to be too reliant on it and hesitant to make instant decisions, especially with penalties.
Beside the obvious need to re-visit the rules, should VAR be used with a challenge system like in tennis where a team get 2 or 3 challenges per match, if you get it wrong you lose a challenge? Can this be used for penalties at least if not offsides as players can’t really judge offsides?
I believe this could restore a little bit of authority and accountability to referees and will not allow players to protest after every single incident.

"I may be an upset Villa fan, but I have channeled my frustration into this post and would like to make a point.

When VAR officials do their thing, they choose a still-frame of the moment when they deem the ball was passed. Analysis of that still frame is only appropriate when distances are scrutinised to the same precision, to which that still frame was chosen on.

**Some calculations:**

\- The impact or contact time between the passer's foot and the ball is ""approximately 0.01 s"" \[1\] and more precisely, around 7.5 ms \[2\].

\- A player making a run will most likely be sprinting at close to his peak velocity, which is approximately 9.2 m/s for a high-level, professional striker \[3\]. The highest measured sprint speed of a footballer was 10.6 m/s \[4\].

\- Thus, while the passer makes contact with the ball, the forward moves a distance of 0.069 m or around 7 cm (using values of 7.5 ms and 9.2 m/s for contact time and sprint speed respectively).

I certainly feel that sometimes, VAR officials aim to judge offside to distances equal to or smaller than 7 cm... Ollie Watkins' offside tonight was by far not the closest. This would be measuring offside to a precision greater than that of our measurement, the still frame.

**Some other points I want to make:**

\- An additional variable could be the last defender moving in the opposite direction at the same time, meaning the margin may well change by 2 \* 7 = 14 cm while the ball is being passed.

\- The time precision in selecting the still frame may well slightly exceed the ball impact time, as there is probably a slightly longer apparent impact time when not analysed close-up in slow motion.

\- At distances of a few centimetres, many other miniscule factors could come into play, such as the length of shirtsleeves...

TL;DR the point I want to make is that offside is being judged to a physically ridiculous and impossible precision. I am surprised (or not really...) the PL/FA/FIFA didn't pay somebody to do these calculations for them.

**Edit, to include: What should be done, how do we move forward**:

For consistency, I understand little can probably be changed this season. A simple solution for offside would be to use thicker lines and judge it to be ""on-side"" if the lines touch. 

I'm fundamentally pro-VAR, but I think it needs a complete revamp, or ""project restart"" next season. Scrap everything we have and start from scratch. Use case studies from the past seasons and other leagues to reimplement what worked and find solutions for what didn't work. Pool the knowledge and opinions of former players, referees and fan associations to rebuild a better VAR.

"I'm a West Ham fan and consider Tottenham, Chelsea and Millwall my team's main rivals. I've generally had a positive opinion of Arsenal and it's fans because: a) some of my extended family support them, b) the good football they played at the beginning of the millennium and c) Ian Wright was one of my earliest idols (that'll date me). I'm telling you this to give you a perspective of where this opinion is coming from.

I've noticed a steady decline of Arsenal since their peak when they had Henry, Bergkamp, Pires, Ljungberg, Campbell et al. (I mean everyone has) because:

1. **Wenger inherited an incredible back 5.** Wenger inherited a back 5 of Seaman, Dixon, Winterburn, Adams and Keown (with Bould able to interchange). All of them played for England (albeit Winterburn and Bould only played a few games). Even as those players have left, Sol Campbell, Lauren and Ashley Cole all got to play with them, learn from them and get integrated into a stable defence. Over time, it became clear that Wenger struggled to recruit and develop defensive players. I believe Arsenal still have a soft spine due to this even today. As a separate point: I think Wenger really planned on Ramsey and Wilshere having run that Arsenal midfield for a decade, which they may have if it hadn't have been for significant injuries at key points in their development.
2. **There's been a lack of investment into the club since Kroenke joined the club.** I've looked at the money spent before and after Kroenke buying the club and there definitely was a downturn in spending. Don't get me wrong, much of this previous spending was poorly done, but the change of ownership seems to be the catalyst. Some might say that the change of stadium was a reason for this, but nothing has changed even after that period.
3. **Scouting has been very questionable and with no real plan.** There have been some good players signed in recent years: Martinelli, Tierney, etc. There's also been a lot of horrendous signings: Mustafi (*£35m),* Perez (£17m), Kolasinac (£0m), Mavrpanos (£1.8m),  Mkhitaryan (swap deal), Lichtsteiner (£0m), Papastathopoulos (£14.4m), Torreira (£27m), Guendouzi (£8m) since 2016. Many of these players didn't seem to fit into the Arsenal team from day 1 of being signed. To add to that, Cedric Soares, David Luis and Willian are all clients of Kia Joorabchian. Soares played 5 times (mostly off the bench) in the season he was brought in on loan, despite a need for backup in the fullback positions. He wasn't Southampton's first choice the last few seasons towards the end of his time there, and were trying to shop him around.  Somehow, he was given a 4 year deal. David Luiz and Willian have been given lucrative deals despite their age. Willian was given a £200K 3 year contract having turned 32. David Luiz had his contract renewed having turned 33 and despite countless poor performances last season. That seems dodgy to me. Key scouts leaving due to Covid cutbacks hasn't helped.
4. **There was a huge power power vacuum when Wenger left.** It's well documented that Wenger did EVERYTHING towards the end of his time with Arsenal (recruitment, coaching, director of football etc). I think him leaving has left a giant power vacuum and changed the politics within the company. Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi leaving abruptly is a sign of that. It definitely wasn't helped by Ivan Gazidis, who seemed to do the bidding of Kroenke.

These points are big picture takes that I have. I think looking in the short - term, I believe that Mikel Arteta should be given more time. If you hire a manager with zero experience in a league with Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho, Brendan Rodgers and Carlo Ancelotti, it has to be because you believe he has the right philosophy and traits to be successful. He's needed to learn on the job during a condenced and unusual season. I think he needs at least one full season and to see if he progress is being made and in fact, I would give him until the end of NEXT season.

Without Auba's goals, Arsenal would've been in a similar position to where they are now at any time in the last few seasons. Now that they've dried up (and to be clear, I'm not having a go at Auba for that - he's been amazing for 2.5 seasons and I haven't seen anyone step up to support him during his poor form), it's exposed what many Arsenal fans have told me previous that they're a very poor team without his goals.

Just to be clear, I don't know whether Arteta is the real deal yet. I've seen some good signs, but I he's not been consistent. I think getting rid of him so quickly won't serve Arsenal and only throw more instability in addition to the above issues.",Arsenal from a (relatively) neutral point of view

Just look at their with/without record.

Not to mention, United as a team have been shocking how is he supposed to be consistent? Look at Aubameyang, there's no doubt he's world class, but even he can't do anything with Arsenal how they are.","Martial is getting ""not a 9"" shouts but last season he got 23 goals without taking penalties"

I’m 17 and don’t get much money so the only Liverpool shirts I can buy are cheap £10 knockoffs from turkey or Spain or wherever. I’ve got enough money to buy a real shirt but I’m not convinced which one. I’ve heard the regular shirts are fine but if I’m finally going to get an actual shirt I would like it to be the best like what they wear on the pitch. So I’m not really sure what the whole comparison is between the Liverpool regular fan kit compared to the vapour kit. Is it also worth the price? It costs £30 more roughly for the authentic vapor kit?,Regular kits vs authentic kits?
"There's always a bit of huddle and bustle, punching back and forth in the area. Each time Wolves defend a corner, the player he marks instinctively gives him a pusht. He pushes back, and neither of them move again until after the ball is played in. Freaking beast",Adama Traore defending corners is the most effect you get
"I'm sorry but Arteta gets way too much excuses regarding him having a bad team and I think it's a load of bollocks. Arsenal's team is nowhere near as bad as Arteta's tactics is making them out to look. They have a ok defense. Tierney and Gabriel are very talented players. Along with Bellerin, Luiz and Leno and that is not a bad defense at all. Up front they've got players like Aubameyang, Pepe, Willian and Saka. Midfield is probably the weakest part of their team but you've still got Partey. I don't see why on earth Arsenal have to play this absolutely dross football that Arteta is forcing upon them. Is this team so bad that they can't muster an open play goal in 7 hours of football. Are they that bad that they can only win 1 out of their last 5 games.Let's be real. Arsenal has easily the 6th best team in the Premier League. They have a better team than Leicester, Wolves, Southampton, Aston Villa. And yet Arteta is having them play like a Championship side. And what has all that defensive football got them? 4 losses in the league and 10 goals conceded is hardly anything to write home about.

Lampard proved last season that you can get something out of a team even if the defense is very weak. I think last season Chelsea and Arsenal this season have about an equal level of talent. Yet compare how Arsenal are playing and how Chelsea played. Arteta has got it completely backwards. People gave him a lot of slack after he won the FA Cup. But the truth is an FA Cup doesn't prove that you are a good manager. A lot of times a inept manager can make a team look much worse than they actually are, in the same way that a good manager can make a team look better than they are. Last season Kovac said Bayern players cannot play high pressing football. He got sacked, a good manager came in named Hansi Flick and lo and behold Bayern suddenly becomes the best pressing team in the world. This is a textbook example of a bad manager who is making his team look worse than they are due to his incompetence and lack of trust in his players. It's no different with Arteta.",Arsenal having a bad team is a myth

Now here is where I have the issue. The game will be suspended and replayed at a later stage. Why ? This inconveniences Manchester United who are ready to play the game. Yet city have failed to keep a track of their players who are getting payed hundreds of thousand of pound just to follow the bloody rules. Where the rest of the country are struggling to put food on the table and now have to stay locked down in the homes. Not mansions with acres of land to run around in. The premier league are also putting in millions to ensure everyone is tested regularly and to ensure that football can keep playing to the rest of us normal folk can have a little enjoyment of having the football on while we are stuck inside. 

A fine is not good enough. If players cannot take responsibility then they should be punished with a ban and the club has either to forfeit the game or field a weakened side. It has to black and white otherwise these players will continue to disrupt the game snd act they are invincible.

Given how Cavani was fined £100,000 and banned for 3 games because he said one word that was deemed inappropriate, why is it that a group of players can break the UK and the biggest punishment they face is a fine that is likely what they earn in a week or even less.

"In the season so far, the off-side calls made by VAR have been the topic of many discussions because it has determined the outcome of many games. 
Adding to this, I have a question:
They spend a lot of effort (drawing perpendicular lines, zooming in, and looking at different camera angles) to see if a person is behind or in front of a defender, but it seems as though they don't spend the same amount of effort to determine WHEN the ball is kicked. When, exactly, is the balled considered as being kicked? 

I suppose it is the moment the ball leaves the kicker's foot? But shouldn't they spend the same amount of effort to find this exact moment and then freeze the frame and move to where the person is on-side or off-side? To me, this moment is just as important as the millimeters they look at at goalside.",VAR: The ball leaving the foot
"So I've spent most of this season so far looking at ways to quantify how much teams have improved/worsened since last season as a way of analysing performance. I had gotten very tired with the general approach of saying ""x team had this many points at this stage last season!"" because that doesn't factor in any way, the order that the fixtures have come in. For example, West Ham started this season with an incredibly difficult run of fixtures and that should have been reflected in any comparisons to performance from last season early on.

Anyhow, this is what I've arrived at thus far.

"1. Liverpool: Become first back to backside to win the title since Man city did with 17/18 to 18/19 while doing without arguably their best player which is just incredible thinking about it 
2. Manchester United: Wins their first title since 2013 and Burno Fernandes shoots up to become a top 8 player on the planet and the best midfielder in the world while Rashford boost up to the top 30 and Ole gets in the top half of mangers in Europe by far and properly this would be their first title win that is totally unexpected from the start
3. Leicester City: It's been five years since their last title win in 2016 which is the greatest achievement in football history winning the premier league in the fashion that they did. but if they do it again then I feel like it would more impressive considering the fact that the quality of the league and the parity feels so much higher then a couple of years ago and Jamie Vardy legacy right now would be one of the most unique in football history considering winning two titles with two totally different styles with two totally different mangers and supporting casts as while his current ranking would shoot up to top 20 to top 15 in the world and a definite top ten striker in the world
4. Tottenham: This feel like a once in a lifetime opptumuinty to win a title in such a wide-open race as Harry Kane has been on another planet lately as Son has become his robin to his batman as he tries to break the assist record for most in premier league history and try to win a golden boot as well. if they win a title then Jose Mourihino's legacy just becomes that much better considering the rock bottom point that he had with Manchester United at the end of 2018. Harry Kane winning his first major trophy would make him a top 5 player in the world without a doubt and the conversation between Kane vs Lewy become a lot tighter than a lot of people think while Son becomes a top 15 player in the world. 
5. Manchester City: I'm not going to lie to you that this man city is a lot more pragmatic than another season by a pretty big margin because pep had to sure up the woeful defense of last year with a lot more rigid and old school approach which got them off to a very slow start which hit rock bottom this season with shocking 5-2 loss at home against Leicester City, but picked back up to this point where they had their best performances by far versus Chelsea which in the first half ripped them into shreds in under 40 mins scoring three goals which 6 or 7 honestly which tells me that they ready to sneak up on Liverpool or whoever at the top in the new few weeks and take their spot through the more defensive-minded approach which scores far fewer goals, but could potentially be the reason that they win their third title in 5 years which for pep will further cement his legacies as a top ten coach of all time period despite all of the money that he has spent and Kevin De Bryune will ended be remember as a premier league legend and the best midfielder of last 5-10 years. 

This season has been so many wild highs and lows that whatever I am saying right now could be null and void in a couple of weeks time and who knows whoever wins this title will be remembered for a very long time as properly one of if not the craziest title races of all time of all of football recent history by far and honestly as a Chelsea fan who properly out of races seeing current results lately go bad, I am just crazy ride ahead honestly",What does a Premier League title do for each of the top 5 teams for their legacies as a whole?
"1. In 2004, Porto was the only champion outside of the four major leagues in the new century. The stars in the array were Deco, Carvalho, and coach Mourinho.

2. In 2005, Liverpool, who was struggling in the Premier League very hard, had a mediocre lineup (I just left Irving, Torres did not come). The stars with a small median are Gerrard and Alonso who have not fully grown up.

3. In 2007, AC Milan, Sheva left, the main lineup is too old, and already has the prototype of Milan nursing home (Inzaghi, Maldini, Dida, Cafu, Gattuso, Seedorf are not young), but The opened Super Kaka saved the Milan pension team, head coach Ancelotti

4. In 2012, Chelsea, Mourinho's team's final peak and craziness, (Lampard, Terry, Drogba, Cech, Essien, the central axis is very old), Torres is in no state, the beginning of the season Boas messed up the Chelsea locker room even more. Later, Di Matteo took the lead to open the defense and win the Champions League many times with a weak victory.","The weakest Champions League champions in the new century, which team do you think is the weakest?"
"Liverpool has 2 points from the last 3 games, and i have to say, I’m quite happy about that. I’m not going to share which club I support, but I am just loving how  open this table is. So many teams are serious title contenders at this point of the season, and it’s looking like it’s going to be an exciting title race to end this season. Cheers!",This table is looking pretty awesome this season...
"A lot of people including me will say yes to this question. Henderson and Fabinho are playing as their CB's and they are missing the flair in the midfield. Who would they sign

SAMUEL GIGOT
Samuel Gigot is a French CB from Spartak Moscow who is 6'3"" and 27 years of age. Spartak are 3rd after 19 games (10/5/4) with 21 goals conceded which is 1.10 goals conceded per game. Gigot has also popped up with 3 goals in the Russian League and could be a half decent mid-term signing. Liverpool have also conceded 21 goals this season but in 2 less games which is 1.23 goals conceded per game. Based off stats, Gigot would be a great addition

JEROME BOATENG
Jerome Boateng is a signing that is much more money than  Samuel Gigot but is a much better player. The German may be in his Late 20's and Early 30's but is one of the most decorated footballers in the history of the game. 2 UCLs, 2 Super Cups, 2 Club World Cups, 8 Bundesligas, 5 German Cups and the World Cup, he's won everything in Germany but can he win anything in England?",Should Liverpool sign a new CB
Why haven't more teams just tried to mark him out of the game completely? (Or as much as possible),The difference in United when Bruno is playing to when he's not is obviously very noticeable
"Just curious of your opinion, in my opinion Van Persie, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Cristiano Ronaldo are the best premier league players ever, they have the class, the skills and the finishing, while the premier league has produced some absolute power houses such as Gerrard, Lampard, Giggs, Cantona, Scholes and hundreds others to me these 4 were something else.

More so - he hasn't won silverware yet. Even Moyes won the Community Shield.,"As manager what has OGS done at Man United that Moyes, van Gaal and Mourinho did not do? I don't see much difference in the approach of the players on the field?"
"Liverpool complaining about injuries, is hilarious. For the last 3 seasons they have had absolute minimal injuries to their core. Meanwhile Utd have had constant Rashford and Martial injuries. Constant centre back injuries. City have had Aguero constantly injured as well as full back injuries. Spurs have had kane and son injuries. Yet Liverpool whinge non-stop.

Edit: Just want to add that Klopp basically played the same starting XI for 2 seasons running and avoided injuries. Every other team has some rotation (apart from Spurs). It's a wonder with all their running, how mane, Salah and Robertson haven't been injured more.",The nerve of Liverpool complaining about injuries
"Given that, to my understanding, the maximum any league can get directly is 4 slots, in a just world, how many would the premier league have given how competitive it has become over recent years","Ideally, how many champions league slots do you think that that the premier league should be allocated given its proportional competitiveness to other European leagues?"

"**Arsenal: David Alaba**. This might be a bit unrealistic, but Alaba is most likely leaving Bayern. If Arsenal can beat Real and others to the player, he would massively improve Arsenal in the form of a center back and being great cover in defensive midfield and at left back, with Tierney and Ceballos both massively underperforming this season, although Tierney has had a few decent games recently. Another option might be Maximillian Arnold, a great midfielder with the capabilities to execute Arteta's vision

**Aston Villa: Jack Harrison**. I hate this fact because I'm a Leeds fan, but a front line consisting of Harrison, Watkins, and Grealish would be arguably the best front 3 outside of the big 6. Harrison is a quality playmaker who can bring what Ross Barkley doesn't bring, and therefore push Aston Villa to do better.

**Brighton: Joao Moutinho**. Brighton right now are a team that, under the right leadership, could actually surprise a few people. A decent defense, decent attack, but a midfield which could use a lot of reinforcement. It's not like Potter doesn't have them playing good football, for example Tariq Lamptey's goal against Spurs (which should not have stood), but Adam Lallana isn't the best creative base for a team gunning for mid table security. Moutinho might not have age on his side, but he's definitely a player that can improve Brighton. A little work on patching up the defense would be useful as well, although that's more a tactical problem than a technical one.

**Burnley: Eddie Howe**. For an actual suggestion though, **Josh King** would add some much needed pace and tooth into a very poor attacking team. Still won't change anything if Dyche tries to make Dwight McNeil dribble the ball from his penalty area to the midfield line then boot it forwards to the attack, but Burnley fans can pray,

**Chelsea: Raphaël Guerreiro**. In my post a few days ago, I preached the importance of not signing big name players who only are that big because they scored 2 penalties and a tap-in to bring their team to the UCL quarter finals before a ""tragic"" 6-1 aggregate loss to Bayern where the player didn't even touch the ball once. Guerreiro actually has talent, something rare in a signing worth over 10m in the EPL. He's proven his abilities at Dortmund, and with Chillwell flopping, he's an escape route. Right now, I'm not sure he's the best signing. Try out Chillwell, and if not him then Marcos Alonso. But if Chillwell is a certifiable flop, Guerreiro is a talent proven by years of hard work at a big club.

**Crystal Palace: Divock Origi**. Any striker worth more than 5m would be a lifesaver for this club. Wilfried Zaha and Eze are being drowned by the lack of playmakers and strikers around them, or at least quality ones. Luka Milojevic works decently in the midfield, Guaita at the back, but you need 2 strikers to run a 4-4-2 system, and I'm only seeing one. Origi isn't the worst striker, although definitely overhyped by Liverpool fans, so why not him? Other options are Salomon Rondon, Arkadiusz Milik, and Jamie Tartt (don't look him up the show will probably make any proper englishman want to die but everybody else finds it nice).

**Everton: Christian Eriksen**. He's played terribly at Inter. He has absolutely no justification playing at a good team again. But Everton do need a decent deep lying playmaker to complement James, DCL, and Richarlison (amongst others). Eriksen is a definite outside option for it. He would definitely be a great player for Ancelotti to have and experiment with, and can change Everton for the better if he returns to his Spurs form.

**Fulham: Pablo Fornals**. Outside option, definitely. But if Fulham can get him, he would inject the midfield with some quality. Lookman isn't the best in the world at penalties, Mitrovic hasn't been clinical, but the midfield is arguably the absolute worst in the Premier League. Fornals would be a realistic, cheap option who could actually help them.

**Leeds United: Igor Zubeldia**. I didn't want to be unoriginal and just say Puig, so I went with Zubeldia.  He's not necessarily a replacement for Phillips or a center back, more as a player who can play anywhere in that region to compensate for the insane amount of injuries they've been picking up.

**Leicester City: Troy Parrot**. Spurs will be reluctant to let him up, but there's no question that Vardy's getting older. That isn't to say Vardy is no longer Premier League quality: I would still call him top 10 strikers in the league if not top 5. However, it isn't wise to rest your hopes on a 33 year old. My suggestion is to sign Parrot and maybe another more proven striker and develop them while Vardy can still work as their first choice to have a good backup in good time.

**Liverpool: Dayot Upamecano**. Good center back to cover for the injuries. If not a purchase then a loan with option to buy. Pretty simple.

**Man City: Kingsley Coman**. Goals needed. Goalscorer of UCL winning goal and treble winner. Outside shot, could become excellent under Pep. If he doesn't instantly take to the EPL though expect many ""flop"" messages.

**Man United: James Justin**. The easy choice for this would be a Pogba replacement. However, I personally think Donny van de Beek is the best option to replace him. James Justin is an outside shot for the left back position, which definitely needs reinforcement with Luke Shaw being the only/best option there. Brandon Williams is nothing compared to Justin, who's had a decent season at Leicester.

**Newcastle United: Ben White**. If Ashley actually opens his wallet for the first time in millenia (barring last summer), Ben White could reinforce the back line at Newcastle to push them even further from the relegation zone. Could cost them upwards of 30m, so a cheaper option may be needed

**Sheffield United: Juan Mata**. This would be a desperate signing without a doubt, but it might actually work. If Wilder can stomach changing to a new system and allowing Mata to be their main playmaker, it might not leave them last. Not saying they would survive, but Mata is a realistic signing who could provide some temporary relief or at the very least a win.

**Southampton: Sergio Romero**. Not to say that Southampton's goalkeepers are not EPL quality, but to be up at the top they need a stronger goalie. Romero doesn't instantly come to mind, but the stats back him to be the best backup goalie in practically the world.

**Spurs: Julian Weigl**. He is the perfect Mourinho player. He can work in the midfield or at the back, young but old enough to be in his prime, and would be perfect cover at Spurs for Alderweireld and Hojberg. 

**West Brom: Olivier Giroud**. Unlikely. But West Brom need a good striker desperately and Lampard's delusions about Tammy at striker and Werner at the wing means it could actually be done. Goals are needed and he can provide them.

**West Ham: John Brooks**. Not particularly great, but a good center back to keep West Ham from conceding goals, which would be much appreciated considering their lack of effective center backs.

**Wolves: Thilo Kehrer**. Seeing Kilman at CB is great considering my widespread condemnation of it (youth talents getting efficient game time) not happening enough, but it also means it's the easiest spot for me to improve so I'm going to be a hypocrite just this once and any other time I see fit. Thilo Kehrer has flown under the radar of impressive young talents, not seeming out of place at one of the biggest teams in Europe. Kilman could definitely still develop and maybe even compete with Kehrer, but either way an improvement would be made.

I’m amazed at how Kane can turn into a playmaker instantly but other times be such a prolific goalscorer. Heung-Min Son has scored a lot of goals too this season thanks to Kane. I still  can’t wrap my head around the fact that the pair have linked up 13 times in half a season, and the striker has gotten more of the assists.

"Just saw some post on this subreddit saying ""Why isnt Pep Guardiola getting any criticsm?"". Maybe because its not his fault? When theres a problem at a football club, you dont just point fingers at the manager unless if hes actually the problem. Is the most decorated manager in history the problem? Or is it the simple fact that your attack just forgot how to finish? Pep Guardiola isnt a puppet master. Hes not the one whos supposed to be scoring into an open net from 2 yards out (Im looking at you Raheem). And its not just that, you actually have City fans who want Pep out. Have they forgot all hes done for them? 100 point season, back to back prems, and fourmidables? 

You also got Mikel Arteta, he came in and instantly transformed Arsenals playstyle. They went on to beat some of the best teams and won 1 and a half trophy (yes, im talking about the community shield. cant count that as a full trophy). He started the season quite shit, but does form not exist for managers? Aubameyang has scored like 1 goal all season and you dont see Arsenal fans saying he should fuck off. Artetas doing good now as well. This was a problem with Unai Emery as well. He almost got them a top 4 finish, had that unbeaten run for a fair amount of time for Arsenal, took them to a Europa League final then the fans turned on him and he lost all his confidence. And his players turned on him as well. Its not gonna get better no shit.

He also has the best H2H record amongst the two managers(vs Ole: 2 meetings WW.  vs Lampard: 4 meetings LDWW). Also for some extra icing, Arteta has a better win record against Klopp than anyone listed(4 meetings WWLW). That's pretty good for someone who only managed a team for 10 months(that's when Arteta last met Klopp) in his managerial career.

"Just seen the penalty United have been given against Villa and hear Gary Neville praising Paul Pogba for being clever for taking a fall once Douglas Luiz puts his arm on him and honestly it’s so infuriating to see football reduced to this. We see some fantastic players get praised for being clever and falling under minimal contact (and it’s all clubs there’s no bias here, we see it from Salah, Kane, Fernandes and Vardy on a consistent basis) and rather than see it being called out and criticised, pundits are now praising it and calling it intelligent play. 

I don’t think I would mind VAR if it actually resulted in these calls being ruled out, but I feel VAR with its constant replaying and zooming of minimal frames if anything gives more free kicks and penalties for any theatrics like this. Of course this isn’t a VAR issue, a rule change needs to be implemented to fix this and actually punish players for this (seriously what happened to booking players who dive?)",Can we stop praising players for being clever for taking a dive?
