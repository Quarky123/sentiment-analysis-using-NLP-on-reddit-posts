"Luka Doncic tonight against the Denver Nuggets: 38 pts, 9 rebs, 13 asts, 4 steals, and 9 points in overtime to secure the Mavs 

What a game from Luka! shot 13/22 and 2/7 from 3","Luka Doncic tonight against the Denver Nuggets: 38 pts, 9 rebs, 13 asts, 4 steals, and 9 points in overtime to secure the Mavs victory"
"Tim Duncan made a rare podcast appearance on the Real Ones Podcast released today. This is I think his second one after the Road Trippin' Podcast 3 years ago.

In the pod, he also talked about who he modeled his game after, his relationship with Coach Pop, his battles with KG, Dirk and Kobe, player empowerment, his most fulfilling championship (spoiler: 2005 versus the Pistons), his brief coaching stint on the Spurs, and more.

Jokic part is at 58:08

The Joker is a lot of fun to watch. His creativeness, his footwork, his passing - it's a lot of fun to watch."""

"Throughout his first 5 games of this season, Griffin did these:

0 Offensive Boards, 0 Blocks, 0 Dunks, 0 And1. He attempted 65% of his shots behind the 3pt line and only 13.3% of his attempts were from 0-3ft area. His average shot distance this season is... 19.1ft. It's almost high as JJ Redick's career number. 

It's painfully clear that his days of an athletic freak is more than just 'gone'. He just strolls through the court like AI after his retirement. Of course, Griffin is still a savvy guy for his size, at least. Decent shooter with some great handles and playmaking ablilities. Despite his limits, he somehow manages to get 14.2 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 3.6 APG with not-that-dreadful efficiency.

One of the most amusing things about watching San Antonio Spurs games to me is watching their coach Gregg Popovich on the sidelines. Somehow, he has not lost his competitive fire at all at age 71 and he remains as spirited as ever toward the refs and his own players. Whenever the cameras cut to him “going Serbian” (in his own words) I’m always curious about what gets him so ticked off. Usually, this is extremely difficult to decipher in the moment. When I watched him fly off the handle late in the 1/5/2021 game between the Spurs and the LA Clippers, I decided to look back at a few plays down the stretch of that game and try to get to the bottom of what had him so angry.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 1

https://streamable.com/mqkme3

In this first clip, Keldon Johnson (no. 3) messes up a switch and doesn’t get to his man (Luke Kennard, no. 5) in time, leading to an open jumper. Although the play does end up in a Clippers turnover after Kennard misses the shot, Pop strikes me more of a process than a results guy and I’m sure defensive execution is something he drills on a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 2

https://streamable.com/rtquxz

The next frustrating breakdown I saw was with about 2:40 left in the 4th, when Lou Williams (no. 23) blows by Johnson for a layup easily with his speed advantage. Demar Derozan (no. 10) is there with the help, but he is a step late and Williams is such a great finisher that there’s not much Derozan can do. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 3

https://streamable.com/npkwyp

The very next play, Johnson and Patty Mills (no. 8) mess up a defensive coverage on the pick and roll and this leads to an open 3 point basket. When Lou Williams sets a ball screen for Kawhi Leonard (no. 2, Johnson’s man), Patty Mills begins guarding Leonard since he thinks the two are supposed to switch the players they are guarding. However, Johnson fights over the screen and stays with Leonard also, leading to Williams popping to the top of the key and nailing the shot. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 4

https://streamable.com/9363l1

The next defensive possession for the Spurs, Patrick Beverley uses a drag screen from Kawhi Leonard to drive the ball to the hoop and pick up a layup. In this play, Johnson stays with the ball handler (Beverley), but floats a little bit too far to the right, giving Beverley an easy lane to the rim. Johnson’s positioning is probably fine in terms of depth, since at this point in the game Beverley had canned SIX 3-pointers and the Spurs might not have wanted Beverley to raise up and shoot the ball as he came off of the screen. However, Johnson should have been able to slow Beverley down enough for help to come. Thus, you notice that he does not drop back to explicitly take away the layup in favor of offering a 3-pointer, but goes up to the level of the screen to run Beverley off of the 3-point line. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Pop reaches the end of his rope

https://streamable.com/5x4h14

I slowed down the clip to try to read Pop’s lips as the camera catches him speaking to the players here. I think he’s saying “HEY! Can you guard somebody?” directed at either Gay, Derozan, or Mills, since Johnson is on the other side of the court.

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/svkuo0


With 5.7 seconds left, Patty Mills had two free throws to ice the game but the Clippers insisted on a replay review instants before Mills was about to shoot his first free throw in an attempt to “ice” him. Basically, the strategy is to make Mills think about the free throw more and psychologically influence him to miss it, a strategy which has been debunked before. When the refs decide to stop and review, you can hear a voice (probably Pop) yelling in the background, “THAT’S BULLS--T”. To be quite honest, Pop is not wrong since I believe the rulebook states that replays must be executed before the foul shooter sets foot on the free throw line. 

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/536dkr


At this point, Pop’s rage knows no bounds and the cameras show his next victim to be Keldon Johnson. I’ve slowed down the clip below, and it appears Pop says, “Oh, is that what you’re saying? Huh? HUH?” possibly dismissing Johnson’s attempts to defend himself. 

&amp;nbsp;


In the end though, San Antonio managed to come out with the tough win on the road against a title contender team, so I’m sure there’s a lot he was pleased about with their performance.",[OC] Why was Pop so pissed? Analyzing a few late game Spurs defensive breakdowns against the Clippers

"The Denver Nuggets HAD been the brightest team with the best looking future in the NBA. This season, they are obviously off to a bad start, going 3-5 after losing to the mavericks. I believe that the two main reasons for this are the departure of Jerami Grant, but the horrendous coaching from Michael Malone. 


Malone has beet trying and forcing a 4 guard lineup, ultra small ball. These lineups have not been working at all, only hurting the team. The opposing team almost always goes on long runs against these 4 guard lineups. Also, rebounding has been a massive problem all season. How do we fix this? By putting 4 guards out on the floor, according to Malone. 


Jerami Grant decided to move to Detroit, wanting to become a larger part of the offense. He was an excellent wing defender, along with Torrey Craig, another wing who left the Nuggets. The Nuggets have repeatedly been getting pounded from deep, and it seems like opposing teams go 50% from downtown due to the lack of good wing defense. The front office replaces these players by signing 2 undersized point guards, leaving the team with 5 point guards. That's 1/3 of the entire roster, point guards.


Because of this, I don't see the Nuggets presenting a challenge to any of the top 4 teams in the west, an utter waste of the superstar talent the team has in Jokic, Murray, and Michael Porter Jr. I see the Nuggets landing at 5th or 6th seed unless there is a significant turnaround.",The Denver Nuggets' disappointing start to the season.
They also barely beat the grizzlies by 2pts who were missing Jaren Jackson Jr and Ja Morant. They have a very misleading record.,Lakers are 0-3 against teams who aren't missing star/key player(s) so far this season

"LeBron's birth date: December 30, 1984

Taj's birth date: June 24, 1985

LeBron was of course drafted out of high school, but this is pretty bizarre.  Taj didn't even play the full 4 years at USC, only 3.  It appears that Taj graduated high school in 2006 when he was almost 21.  I found [this article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2009-06-28-0906270074-story.html) that says he was homeschooled for a while before attending a traditional high school, but there doesn't appear to be much more information out there.  Does anyone know the full story here?","Despite the fact that LeBron James was drafted in 2003 and Taj Gibson was drafted in 2009, LeBron is less than 6 months older than Gibson"
"Randle with 30 points, 16 rebounds and 7 assists on 10/26 FGs, 0/5 3PTs and 10/12 FTs in 40 minutes as Knicks defeat the Jazz

"As most people know, the current league protocol is if a player has been in contact with someone who had it, they have to isolate for 7 days at minimum (even if they have had the virus before you can get reinfected but the evidence suggests it isn't very common). You also can't get reinstated even if you have multiple negative tests in the following days. 

Obviously this makes sense to protect the other players but this has always seemed odd to me because in order to be consistent in a situation like the one with seth curry, you now have to cancel all of the sixers games for a week as the whole team has been exposed (the wizards too).

Allowing the sixer games to continue also creates the very bad precedent that it's better to have your whole team get exposed and hope no one gets it than just having one star player. 

I personally think the league will keep the sixer games going provided the players test negative cause money over everything but wonder what you guys think","If the league allows Sixers games to continue this week, do the Nuggets and the Nets have a legitimate grievance for the Michael Porter Jr/Kevin Durant situation?"

3. Both gotten rid of in replaced with a new more popular player of their position and a somewhat similar play-stye (LeBron and Lonzo) 

4. Both find their way on to a thought to be bad New York team (Nets and Knicks) and out preform and drastically improve as players becoming the surprising new leader of the team. 

5. The team out preforms expectations and

While Jokic isn't the best regular season performer (although this season he may prove us wrong), he always step's his game up in the playoffs. In only his second year, he made it to the conference finals, only losing to the eventual champs. Will Jokic be as good as the players I've listed here? Not super likely. Is he showing potential to be one of the best playoff performers of this era? I think yes.",[OC] Jokic's playoff stats vs HOFer's first 2 years in the playoffs
"Famed point center Bismack Biyombo has started the last seven games due to a Cody Zeller injury, and averaged 3.0 assists per game, after recording zero coming off the bench on opening night. He has recorded 21 assists in these games.

Over this same stretch, Terry Rozier, who was once seen as a point guard for some reason, has recorded 20 assists, 2.9apg.

Felt this was a stat that needed to be known by more people. Do what you like with this information.

"Noticed this intro/outro while watching Spurs vs Lakers rn and it was really dope. I YouTubed it using said title and I found it! One of the coolest sports theme? And is there possibly a better/longer version?

Edit: found a longer and more fluid version. Quality a little lower though

There has to be a question of Paul George's new reputation as 'soft' is due to his openness about mental health, which this article brings up.

Paul George doesn't know where it's coming from: 
&gt; Last year was last year. I'm in a new situation; I am in a different mindset. Any of that hate stuff, you got to ask them. I don't know where that's coming from. 

Ben Rohrbach in the article directly blames this new hate on Paul George's openness about mental health.
&gt; Was George “soft” when he rebuilt himself into an MVP candidate after suffering one of the most brutal leg injuries the game has ever seen in 2014? No. Was he “soft” for taking umbrage when Cameron Payne wildly jumped on that same leg after the whistle was already blown, sparking Booker’s outburst on Sunday? No.

&gt; We all know why Booker said what he said. Except, George is not “soft” for having the courage to share publicly what others in the NBA would not. He is stronger. Mental health struggles are real, especially during the pandemic, and professional athletes are not immune. Paul himself called this his top priority as the National Basketball Players Association president over the summer. His lines on the court might be blurrier.&gt;","[Rohrbach] Paul George is back on top because he shared his mental health struggles, not in spite of them"
"So this is more about fit then anything. You want to build a team that can try to win this season. I’m gonna give you some options, use them to create a 8 man rotation(or just a starting 5 if you’re lazy). Just follow the directions and you’ll get your team.

If you did all of those you should have a total of 8 players. How is the team you just made. Who are your starters and bench guys? Is your team capable of winning a finals in today’s nba?",Follow the guideline to create the best team you can. Why did you pick who you did and how do they fit together?
I know Josh Hart plays warzone. He talks about it quite often on Twitter. Also didn’t bron play football in hs? Just interested to hear this tbh.,Best gamer/multi sports athletes in the NBA?
"I haven't.

One of the minor talking points in the bubble was that players now have a lot more space under the basket and don't have to worry about falling into clunky cameras and tweaking an ankle. I thought I would have noticed the absence of those specific camera angles, but I nearly forgot about them. The main angles they would provide are the baseline angles (used sparingly) and for halftime/post game interviews .

I think we should do away with that angle permanently and have the cameraman needed for interviews sit elsewhere.","Between the bubble and the start of this season, have you noticed the lack of baseline cameramen in terms of the camera angle they provide?"

"He started the game 0-6 from the field, then went absolutely nuclear. He had two and-ones and a crucial block on Bradley Beal (who was incredible, scoring 60 points) down the stretch.

Embiid's performance was just enough to eke out a 141-136 win, keep the home winning streak alive and propel the Sixers to an NBA-best 7-1.

edit: 38 points, not 37 (that's 63% of a Bradley Beal!)","Joel Embiid: 37 pts on 11-20 FG, 3-4 3PT, 13-13 FT. Also added 8 reb, 5 ast, 3 stl, 3 blk"
"Timberwolves fans told everybody that Jimmy Butler and Thibs were the problem.    

Last year Jimmy proved them wrong by being the guy to lead his team to the finals.    

Now Thibs is proving he is still a great coach.        

Meanwhile the Timberwolves still suck.      

IDK maybe the problem is KAT?",How bad does it look that both Jimmy Butler and Thibs are succeeding after being run out of Minnesota?
"I was bored and decided to look up what he was up to now with the Pistons, and as it turns out he's giving them a solid 15/4 in 20 minutes a night. Pretty good for someone who spent the majority of last season in the G-League with his career looking like it was gonna go by the wayside. 

Is this just another product of good numbers on a bad team, or is Josh Jackson = future all star back on the menu?",Is Josh Jackson's resurgence for real?
"It seems like literally all of the coaches hate doing it and they usually give non-answers anyway, so what’s the point of doing the interviews at all?",What are your opinions on the mid-game coach interviews?
Austin Rivers has hit some clutch shots in the previous 2 games including a dominating performance in the 4th quarter tonight. 3 years/10 million seems like a steal so far.,Austin Rivers in the Knicks win tonight vs the Jazz: 23 pts/3 rebs/2 asts on 9/14 FG (5/7 3pt) including 14 consecutive points for the Knicks late in the 4th
"Here are some guys who I think deserve a little more love, even if none of them are necessarily not liked

George Hill: An extremely steady, calm, two way point guard. I love how he literally never plays outside his comfort zone, seems like a good leader, and appreciate the work he's put into his three point jumper. 

Lowry: When people talk about the ""desire to win"", I think Lowry embodies that as much as one can. Dude is literally always finding some way to impact the game if he has the ball or doesn't. Defensively he's obviously a master charge taker, and sturdy post defender. Offensively you can trust he'll end up doing something valuable with the ball. Whether it's getting to the line, hitting a three, or finding a teammate. He does have the tendency to flop, but overall, such a joy 

Redick/Korver: Just absolute professionals who have put a ridiculous amount of work towards perfecting one skill: Shooting the ball. A shit ton of repetition and practice to become near all star level players despite lacking impressive physical tools. 

Josh Hart: My favorite player by far, the reason being that his entire game is literally effort based. Hart has genuinely below average talent. He's not a skilled ball handler, not super athletic, and doesn't have a good shooting stroke, or high court vision. The only reason at all he's a serviceable player is because he tries really freaking hard on the defensive end, bodying up bigger guys and securing rebounds like few others guards in NBA history. Even then he sometimes gets lost on defense. He basically is an example of how far 100 % effort in NBA games can get you",Under-appreciated players!
Not including the injured players obviously. But there are a few names that come to my mind immediately. What do you think?,What player do you think has regressed the most this season from last? So far anyway

He looked the best he has since the shutdown although Toronto took another L in their schedule. However if Siakam can get his shit together the Raptors might be able to follow suit. Let's see if he can continue the improved performance after his struggles since last year,"Pascal Siakam comes alive despite another loss: 32 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists on 11/21 shooting"
"When Trae Young doesn't get 15+ free throw attempts off BS foul calls, he struggles. His 3pt shot has been off all season (shooting only 33%) and without the FTs to rely on, Young struggled all night as the Hawks lose to the Hornets","Trae Young tonight: 7 points/5 rebounds/3 assists/7 turnovers on 2/9 FG, 0/3 3pt/, 3/3 FT in 35min"
"Since 2011, 40% of first overall picks were named Anthony (including Karl-Anthony). It is quite amazing how one name can be connected to such a coveted draft position. While we are yet to see how all of their careers will turn out, it seems there are some definite perks to having the moniker. In the grand scheme of things it's astounding to think that around 5.5% of all number one picks have been bestowed the same first name. This thought came to me out of the blue, but let me know if y'all have any theories......",Does Being Named Anthony Increase the Chance You're the 1st Overall Pick?

"There are supposedly talks of NBA expansion and Seattle - if you believe the rumors - is at the top of the list of cities capable/deserving of a team. 

If the NBA was to expand it would likely add 2 teams rather than just the one. 

What other city would be the best fit for a new franchise and why?  

Vegas seems like the obvious answer for a number of reasons. Or do they go international and look at returning to Vancouver or opening shop in Mexico City? Perhaps the Cincinnati/Louisville/Lexington? Reward the heartland with another team in either St. Louis or KC? California seemingly has enough teams and they were indifferent toward the Chargers, but San Diego is the largest city in America without an NBA team.",Along with Seattle - what other city would be the best for an NBA expansion team?

"I was just thinking how all the recent mvps led their team in win shares. And as I was looking through stats I saw Khris Middleton was the Bucks leader. If this kept up, and hypothetically if the bucks went 72-0, Giannis would most likely win MVP, but Middleton would be the leader in win shares. Because popularity etc etc.

5. Pelicans
6. Warriors
7. Kings
8. Blazers

Here was my predictions for the standings before the start of the season (bracket number is where how far that are in reality vs where I predicted them as of January 6th 2020):

**My predictions:**  
East:

1. Nets ( -7)
2. Bucks ( - 4)
3. Celtics ( - 1)
4. Heat ( -7)
5. 76ers ( +3)
6. Raptors ( -7)
7. Wizards ( - 5)
8. Pacers ( +5)

West:

1. Lakers ( -1)
2. Nuggets ( -10)
3. Mavs ( -6)
4. Clippers ( +1)
5. Jazz ( +1)
6. Warriors ( 0)
7. Rockets ( -6)
8. Suns (+7)
9. Blazers - toss up between 8/9 (+1)

1/10th of the season through, most of these picks look horrible.

I made these predictions an hour before the first game of the season. Let me know if you're curious for some of my picks or what your own picks were. For instance, for the Rockets I made the assumption that James Harden wouldn't play for the Rockets again and would be traded for some decent pieces (I was wrong).",How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?
"I suspect I'm over-thinking this, but I dislike the term 'small ball' because playing small is not the point. It's caught on because it rhymes and is relatively easy for people to picture: More small players, fewer big players.  But it's not about being small for smallness's sake, because if a team could play five big, fast, skilled, switchable guys who were all 7 feet tall, then that's what teams would do. A line-up of five Kevin Durants would be amazing. 

The point of what's commonly called 'small ball' can vary, but it's usually some variation or combination of the following:

* speed ball - fast, up-tempo play
* skill (or versatile) ball - multiple ball handlers, playmakers, shooters who can present many offensive looks
* switchable ball - similar to the previous item, but more of a defensive focus on guys who can switch without compromising match-ups

If you could rebrand 'small ball' then what would you call it instead?",What's a more accurate term for 'small ball'?
"The NBA credited Lamelo Ball with a 3 pointer with 2:12 seconds left in the 3rd quarter that was actually hit by Devonte' Graham. Here is the quote from the box score and here's a picture curtesy of a redditor below: [https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9](https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9)

"" **2:12 LaMelo Ball makes 24-foot three point jumper (P.J. Washington assists) 77-64 ""**

This shot can clearly be seen just after the 7:00 mark of the video highlights from the game (posted literally by the NBA): [https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422](https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422)

Devonte' Graham made the shot - NOT Lamelo Ball.

Is the NBA trying to inflate the stats of Lamelo Ball? Or did Vegas do this somehow as the over/under for Graham was set at 11.5 and this shot would have made the over hit?

TL;DR: Graham scored 14 points this game but was only credited with 11 after this 3 was given to Ball instead of him.",Devonte' Graham had his 3 pointer incorrectly credited to Lamelo Ball
"“ Bradley Beal (4) has passed Gilbert Arenas (3) for most 50-point games in Wizards franchise history. Beal has 57 points after 3 quarters.”

[Source](https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1346999788227624962?s=21)

Beal is on fire this game. 57 (19-29FG) points through 3 quarters vs the 76ers.

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267269",Bradley Beal (4) has passed Gilbert Arenas (3) for most 50-point games in Wizards franchise history. Beal has 57 points after 3 quarters.
"Another thing the player shouldn’t be a second option. You can only name a player who was the first option. 



P.s. I honestly would go with lamarcus aldrige even thou in his best season from scoring perspective was only 23ppg i think he is still one of the best in this category.",Who are the besr scorers in nba history to never average more than 25 ppg in a season?

"I think the Lakers are in a tier of their own, and the Clippers are in a tier of their own below the Lakers. 

It's impossible to predict if Harden decides to buy in with Houston or if a trade will go through. And I don't have faith in NOLA if Zion doesn't start playing defense and if SVG doesn't figure out how to maximize his players instead of running Ingram hero ball down the stretch.

So other than LA, I think these are the six teams likely to make the Western playoffs. All of them except the Suns have proven they can make the playoffs with their current core and coach. And CP3 has better teammates on the Suns than he did on the Thunder, so with their hot start showing things are working it's hard to think they'll miss the postseason. 

So how do you rank these six Western teams? I'd say Nuggets, Jazz, Suns, Mavericks, Warriors, Blazers.","Rank the following Western playoff teams: Suns, Jazz, Nuggets, Blazers, Mavericks, Warriors."
There shouldn't be a question at all that he is an All-Star this year. Dude has been absolutely on fire and is by far the floor general for the Pacers.,"Malcolm Brogdon career high with 35 points, on 13/25 FG, 4/6 3PT, and 7 assists."

"Hey y'all, pretty hectic day in the US yesterday so it may have been pretty easy to miss what went on in the Association last night, rest assured I have got you covered. Lots lots lots went on in the NBA last night and I really tried to get you guys the scoop here, let's get into it.(Note this is generally tailored for NBA Fantasy players, but still something all NBA fans would enjoy)

&amp;#x200B;

Nightly Notables

&amp;#x200B;

* Markelle Fultz goes down with a torn ACL
   * Extremely devastating new for Fultz and the Magic. Fultz was averaging career highs in nearly all of his stats and this crucially hurts his development as a player. 
   * I can not stress this enough, but if Cole Anthony is available, add him ASAP. He filled in for Fultz and played a career high 32 minutes. Anthony is a very talented rookie and it will be interesting to see how he fares as the lead point guard for his squad

&amp;#x200B;

* Bradley Beal Drops Career High 60 in the L to Embiid's 38
   * Wow were the stars shining in this one, fitting that the game with no defense yesterday featured a team from Washington playing in it. Beal exploded for 57 points in three quarters, but only scored three more the rest of the game as the 76ers took over late and were able to contain him a bit. Beal's final line was 60 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists
   * Embiid on the other side of the court scored 38 points on 11/20 shooting and 13/13 from the stripe to go along with 8 boards and 5 assists. Embiid's Sixers are off to a sizzling hot NBA best 7-1 start and I think it is only fair for the MVP Embiid talks to start brewing up a bit. 
   * Also want to note that Simmons and Westbrook were their usual triple double threat side-kicks with a 17/6/12 line for Simmons and 20/8/12 line for Westbrook. They continue to prove their worth as daily top options at the PG spot.

&amp;#x200B;

* Hayward, Grant, Brogdon, and White all decide to drop career highs too
   * Gordon Hayward looked awesome against the Hawks pouring in 44 points and hitting some tough shots all game long. It is great to really see Hayward fully healthy and really looking aggressive and confident. It will be interesting to see if he can build upon this explosion
   * Jerami Grant has been terrific early on for the Pistons and although they took the L to Giannis and the Bucks, Grant still dropped 31 points and grabbed 10 boards to go along. Grant has really rewarded those who drafted him in their leagues and seems to have the green light to shoot whatever he wants for Detroit. 
   * Malcom Brogdon dropped 35 points on the Rockets on 13/25 from the field and 4/6 from beyond the arc. Brogdon has been playing at a high level this whole season and Warren's injury has elevated his game even further as he is averaging 26.5 PPG since Warren went down. Brogdon is turning into an elite option at PG for fantasy owners and is really stepping up his game this season
   * Coby White looked incredible in the loss vs the Kings, putting up a new career high with 36 points in 39 minutes. White is starting to find some more consistency as the season progresses with his third straight 20+ game, but he probably won't be playing nearly 40 minutes a game when Sato returns to the lineup

&amp;#x200B;

* Most Improved Randle?
   * Julius Randles has been to simply put it incredible to start the new season. He continued his great play with a 30 points, 16 board, 7 assist outing in a come back win vs the Jazz to lead the Knicks to a 5-3 record this early season. Randle has become a nightly triple threat type of player and after being skeptical at first, it really is looking like Randle might actually be a star player in this league 
   * Also want to point out, Thibs is back to being Thibs, nearly all of his starters played 30+ minutes and Randle, Payton, and Robinson all were either close to or over 40 minutes.  Also important to note Rivers has seen back to back 30+ minute games and is solidifying a role in his rotation, while Quickley saw just 5 minutes. Rivers played great last night in the clutch and had 23 points off the bench for NYK. I would not give up on Quickley entirely as the prior game Thibs trusted him down the stretch. Definitely a situation to monitor. I am curious what happens when Burks returns

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Wall Shines again as Harden struggles with his shot 
   * John Wall impresses again with an efficient 28 points on 12/20 shooting to go along with 6 rebounds and 3 assists in 37 minutes. Wall is back to looking like his healthy, speedy, dynamic self that we saw what feels like ages ago in Washington. He is really looking like a legit top option at the point guard position
   * Harden on the other hand ""only"" scored 15 points on 5/14 shooting and 1/5 from three, although he was in his playmaking mode with 12 assists. His past two games he's gone 10/31 from the field and 4/16 from three. Would not be too concerned about Harden obviously as we all know how talented he is, but I think there could be some reason to believe his points might dip from what we are used to due to the talent on this team with Wall+Woods+Cousins. Again would not be worried much with Harden though as he is one of the best scorers of all time and he has had immensive amount of success with talent around him before, but just some quick knee-jerk reaction here and maybe even could be a time to try and buy him low.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Raptors continue to struggle while the Suns continue to impress 
   * Devin Booker lead the Suns in a balanced attack over with 24 points, Deandre Ayton grabbed a double double with 11 and 16, and CP3 dished out 8 assists as the Suns improve to 6-2 on the early season. The addition of Paul has really helped this team continue what they started in Orlando 
   * The Raptors on the other hand took another L and now fall to 1-6 on the season, and especially with the season being shortened 10 games, they need to figure this out soon. Siakam had his best game of the season dropping 32 points to go with 9 rebounds, but still was not enough to take down Phoenix  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Hitters

* Davis Bertans came off the bench but played 32 minutes and ended up starting the 2nd half instead of Avdija who only saw 15 minutes of action. Bertans has seen back to back games of 30+ minutes and is seeming like he is back to startable territory due to his 3pt presence
* Seth Curry caught fire with 28 points shooting 11/14 from the field and 6/7 from three, which included a 5/5 first quarter from beyond the arc
* Early DPOY front-runner in my eyes, Myles Turner was at it again, this time swatting 8 shots against the Rockets 
* Tatum and Brown combine for 48 in Celtics dub over Heat
* Jimmy Butler plays his best game of the season dropping in 26 points in the loss to the C's 
* Zion and BI combine for 53 in the loss to OKC
* Steven Adams records his first career triple double with a 10/11/10 line
* Coby was not the only Bull doing work, LaVine put up 32 points and Carter grabbed a double-double with 11 points and 17 boards
* DeAaron Fox left the game with hamstring tightness and did not return for the 2nd half, his injury will be one to monitor for sure, I personally do not believe it is too serious as he was celebrating the win with his team on the bench and was moving around. 
* Bagley put up his best game of his season with 21 points and 12 boards, while running mate Richaun Holmes added 24 points on 10/11 shooting as well
* PG and Kawhi match each other with 21 a piece in the Clippers win over the Warriors as Steph struggles with his shot only scoring 13 points

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Report

&amp;#x200B;

* Tyrese Haliburton 
   * Haliburton came back after missing his past two games and after not doing much in the game, turned up in the 4th quarter scoring 15 of 17 points, which included some clutch 3s, and finished the game with 7 boards, 6 assists, and 3 steals. Fox went down in the first half with hamstring tightness, which I do not believe to be too serious, but still he missed the remainder of the game and if is forced to miss time, Haliburton is for sure startable in my eyes and a great DFS play
* Lamelo Ball
   * Ball continues to really show out scoring 16 points on 6/12 shooting and snagging 8 boards to go along with 5 assists. The BC Vytautas product has started to come into his own and is looking like a real threat in this league. He only saw 23 minutes of action tonight, but more minutes are bound to be coming this way if he keeps this play up
* Issac Okoro
   * Okoro returned back to the starting lineup after missing the past 5 games for the Cavs and saw 28 minutes if action. He scored 10 points on 4/5 shooting, while he is not the most attractive fantasy player currently, he should be monitored in 9cat leagues due to his efficiency and has a do-it-all type game 
* Saddiq Bey
   * Bey poured in 20 points and grabbed 10 boards for his first career double double in 24 minutes.  Bey has had a solid start to his career in Detroit and is a player that is worth adding, due to him starting and playing around 30 minutes when the Pistons opt to rest Blake 
* Payton Prtichard
   * Pritchard continues to produce early on and especially without Teague in the lineup. Pritchard saw just 20 minutes last night though with Smart returning to the lineup, but scored 6 points including the game winning tip and grabbed 6 boards and had 4 dishes. He struggled with his shot going 3/10 from the field and 0/4 from three, but I would not be too concerned about that for now as his prior game he shot 8/13 from the field and 2/4 from three. Pritchard's season long value is not as promising though because eventually Kemba will be back for this team and Teague will still be there starting too for now 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am Excited to see tonight

* The Balkan Battle
   * Jokic and the Nuggets are taking on Luka and the Mavs in what is sure to be a fun game from the two European studs, won't be suprised if both players end with triple doubles
* Kyrie and the KD-less Nets get to take on Embiid and the sizzling 76ers
   * Two of the top Eastern Conference squads take on each other tonight, but how will the Nets fare with no KD, will they be able to repeat what they did vs Utah

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the Night: Bradley Beal(60 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 20/35 from the field, 38 minutes)

Dud of the Night: Trae Young(7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 2/9 from the field, 35 minutes)

Rook of the Night: Tyrese Haliburton(17 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 7/15 from the field, 34 minutes)

Player to Target: Cole Anthony

"i was watching the game last night and noticed something interesting.. they had Dennis/Wes/Kuzma/Bron/AD out there.. going to run a high pnr with Bron/AD as they normally do at the end of games, so seeing the lineup my guess was okay.. it's going to be 5 out, spread pnr 

then i saw AD point to Dennis to stand in the dunker spot.. which was interesting.. https://i.imgur.com/U3Y5GW2.png

AD then sets the screen for LeBron, and as LeBron gets inside the three point line, Dennis runs to the three https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png

AD dunking the ball while Dennis is at the three https://i.imgur.com/YHr8m0k.png

reasons for doing this 

typically, a smaller player would be on Dennis, so when they come to help AD can just finish over them 

secondly, https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png looking at this picture, Brandon Clarke is the help guy now who was guarding Dennis, so Tyus has to be the in between guy focusing on Dennis running to the three and Wes in the corner, that's a pretty routine pass for AD if he chooses to do that 

just something i found interesting, don't typically see a 5 out pnr ran like this",Lakers run a LeBron/AD pnr with a wrinkle

"The goal here is to try to make the best 15 man expansion team off non-protected players.

Rules:

1) Assume its the 2021 offseason and we're having an expansion draft

2) Post 8 players/rights from your favorite team that you would like to protect as a parent comment. To make it more interesting, this includes restricted/bird/non-bird salary rights. For example, the Hawks can use a keeper on John Collins' restricted rights this offseason instead of an 8th actual player considering Collins is going to be an FA and not under contract with the Hawks this offseason.

3) I'll reply in the comment thread on who I'm plucking your team (only 1 player per team.) I can choose a player's restricted rights instead if you do not choose to protect them. 

4) Obviously since there are more teams than roster spots, I can choose to pass on picking from your team",League Expansion Game
"Ben Simmons and Draymond Green are two of my favorite players to watch and I think both have similar, but unique skillsets that I thought would be fun to compare, and I’m curious which player would be more valuable to your favorite team? 

Ben obviously is not close to Draymond in terms of legacy right now. Dray has proven to be a ‘16 game player’ and a champion. Ben has been co-leader of a winning team each year of his career  but hasn’t got past the 2nd round in the 2 playoff runs he played.

That being said In terms of skills I think they’re both great in transition. Ben is faster but I think a little more turnover prone than Dray. They both focus on finding shooters and Draymond clearly knows how to get Steph and Klay open. (For example look at the last shot Steph got for 62!)

In the half court they have different roles. Draymond is a more willing shooter and roller and Ben is a better at driving off the dribble and a bit better at better at passing imo.

And on defense they’re both great but in different ways. Draymond will anchor and coach a defense as well as anyone in the league and he’s so smart at reading pick and rolls and knowing players offensive habits so he can stifle them.

Ben on the other hand will defend the hell out of your best scorer and could very well be the best  1v1 defender in the league, while leading the league in steals last year, but he won’t be a rim protector.

I'd be interested to hear them discuss anything about basketball and their careers.,Many years from now do you think there will ever be a 1-on-1 interview between Michael Jordan and Lebron James?
Money wise I know it would be a plus but I mean in terms of viewership. We would have 2 more teams which will probably suck for the first few years and it would add to the already abundance of not so good teams. A lot of the teams in the nba aren’t that good and adding more would just spread out the talent more and worsen the situation.,Would an expansion team be better Orr worse for the NBA?

"As a Knicks fan, I am used to my team being projected to lose. They have not been the Vegas favorite to win in a single game this season. I pulled up the over/unders for the season to compare Vegas predictions to actual game outcomes and the Knicks have been the most underrated team of this young season. This figure shows the difference between actual and Vegas-predicted victories (teams that have beaten their odds plot higher on the y-axis):

[Actual vs predicted wins for 2020-2021 season](https://imgur.com/6nfIeWo)

I was curious how these trends stacked up against the last several years, so I pulled in data from the 2014-2019 seasons for comparison. The solid lines show a 1:1 trend (i.e., if Vegas predictions were perfect) and the dotted lines show the actual trends for each season. Lower slopes for the actual trendlines indicate that Vegas' predictions favored the high-win teams too frequently.

"The most impressive thing about the Knicks on their hot start is that this team is dead last in 3PA and 27th in 3P. They are winning with barely any 3s at all.

Context: 
&gt;Appearing on the All Things Covered podcast last Wednesday, Shaq was hardly covert when insulting Gobert who signed a $205 million contract extension with the Utah Jazz, saying “I’m not gonna hate, but this should be an inspiration to all the little kids out there. You average 11 points in the NBA, you can get $200 million,”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The former Los Angeles Lakers center also mocked Gobert, a player for the Utah Jazz, posting a photoshopped photo of him dunking on Gobert with the caption: “I would had 45 pts 16 rebound ten missed free throws in three quarters. He woulda had 11 pts four rebounds and fouled out in 3 quarters. I’m a G ”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Rudy responded on IG with: “I guess we’ll never know” and then continued on Twitter: “There is no beef. If people wanna keep speaking negatively about me or keep discrediting what I do it’s on them and all that does is show who they are. I will always be happy for a brother beating the odds. And I’m gonna keep beating the odds.”

&amp;nbsp;

How good is he at protecting the paint? Does he chase blocks? And how switchable is he?",How good is Myles Turner's defense?
"Since blocks and steals doesn't really sum up player's defensive production, what is the best stat to look for when deciding player's defensive worth? Is there an NBA stat that shows for each player how many points have opposing players on the same position scored on him per game (basically how many points a player allows for the opposition)?",How to decide the best defensive player?

"I was browsing on IG and i saw a post of Lamelo ball passing the ball to his teammate at the end of the shot clock , it had like tens and thousands of likes and the amount of people in the comments saying “he slick for that” or whatever is too damn high.",Idk who needs to hear this but a shot clock violation TO counts towards the team TO not the players.
"It’s wayyy too soon to make any declarative statements here, but this draft class has a number of players that have impressed already. 

Oh before I go further, if you just want to hear the question and respond:

tl;dr, How normal is this for young players in their first 10 games? Has this draft already exceeded expectations? How have the rookies this year looked in comparison to previous years? Better or worse?


Wiseman and Edwards have both impressed, lamelo has been promising (although he has some cold streaks), Devin Vassell has been a rookie that pop believes in enough to play, Pat Williams has been impressive in Chicago, and, of course, Haliburton has been incredible. 

I don’t think this proves necessarily that everyone was sleeping on the draft class saying “no one is worth trading up for.” I’m really not sure how many rookies over perform in their first few games. I am a stupid man so I can’t remember what the normal amount of impressive rookies is. However, there’s a lot of guys to be excited about. Hope we see more promise as we get further(think when Killian Hayes, obi toppin, and Isaac okoro have shown flashes as well, okoro is looking like a guy who could play for a long time). Also think both quickley and tyrese maxey have all the makings of a guys who could develop into solid contributors  for any team  long term. 

Bonus: too soon guess at all rookie first team!

Haliburton 

Edwards

Vassell

Williams 

Wiseman 



Second team:

Killian Hayes*

Tyrese maxey

Lamelo 

Isaac okoro 

Isaiah stewart*



*note: just think when these rookies on the pistons(along with Sadiq bey) start clicking and get into the nba groove, you could see much improvement. I know precious and okongwu both are probably higher.","8 games in, 2020 draft class has looked promising!"
"It would probably be a cheap trade too. Most likely a second round pick and  another 2nd round pick swap (where NY gets the better of the 2)for Dennis and it’s a low risk high reward thing. If he hits then you have his bird rights and can re-sign him next year. If it misses then it was only 2nd rounder that was gone. 

Knicks have 4 point guards on the team (Payton, IQ, Frank, DSJ) and 2 others who can play spot minutes at the point (Rivers, Burks) so there’s not much loss for them their. 

I know the magic have two other PG’s in Bone and Mane but they’re on two way contracts 

Thoughts?",To improve their PG Depth the Orlando Magic should consider trading for Dennis Smith Jr

"https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/article/ujiri-webster-misses-years-led-raptors-struggles-see-now/

&gt;Ibaka wanted to stay with the Raptors and even coming off a career-year, the veteran understood that it might mean having to settle for a one-year deal as the club was doing everything in their power to avoid taking on commitments that would interfere with their cap space in 2021.

&gt;But the Raptors’ first offer – about $12 million for the 2020-21 season – was below what he was expecting and while Toronto came up to $14 million, they were still trying to keep some powder dry to pursue Gasol. That didn’t go over well with Ibaka who, according to multiple sources, resented having to play behind the Spanish international and wasn’t going to sign on for a shared role again. Ibaka quickly pivoted to the Los Angeles Clippers and their two-year deal for $19 million.

&gt;In retrospect, the Raptors absolutely could have kept Ibaka without being a tax team or otherwise altering their off-season plans now or in the future.

Reading this little tidbit from the article, it looks like the Raptors gave Serge a lower offer than he had expected at first, a one year $12 million dollar deal. Then they brought it up to $14 million, but also wanted to keep their options open to retain Marc Gasol as well. Apparently, this was a reason Ibaka decided to go to LA because he didn't want to share a role with Gasol. Serge now gets what he wants, starting for the Clippers. The Raptors end up losing both.

What are your thoughts? Did Serge seem unhappy about his minutes last season?","[Grange] Raptors offered Ibaka 12m/1y, then upped it to 14m/1y but Serge didn't want to share role with Gasol"

"Dude has been a godsend as a coach. He's been managing to get guys who suck bootyhole at defense play good defense. DSJ was playing great defense before injury, Kevin Knox went from playing garbage defense to around average, Bullock went from average to above average. 

On top of that his rotations have been solid. He's put in the right guys at the right moments to secure the win. Also with his rotation, the Knicks have had 6-7 guys injured for almost all their games, and he's able to have the team play hard with only an 7-8 man rotation on these nights.

"Couple years ago, many would say players are playing at their best when they’re 27-28 years old. Fast forward to today, we still have plenty of players performing extremely well in their 30s


Just a small sample, there are plenty more: 
Hayward (30 years old): Just dropped a new career high. Currently averaging the same numbers, at a higher efficiency that he put up during his all star season. 

Paul George (30 years old): Currently having second best season in terms of points per game, career high in assists.

LBJ (36 years old): Pretty self explanatory 

James Harden (31 years old): 29.4 ppg, second best season in terms of assists per game. 

KD (32 years old): 28 ppg, career high in three point percentage

"Ever since I've been an NBA fan, the West was a conference that had absolute powerhouse teams. I've always found the 2007-2008 season very interesting for the very reason. I don't want this to come off as an insult to the East teams now, cause I think now the East is in a very interesting spot w/ loads of young talent doing well for their teams &amp; who have a lot of good seasons in the future. The west was fully loaded &amp; if you wanted to make the playoffs that year in the west, you HAD to play your heart out every single game.

The Southwest division had 4, FOUR, 50+ win teams. No division in the East had more than 2, &amp; only 3 East teams had more than 50 wins.

No West team secured a playoff spot until April 4, 2008.

The Rockets &amp; Suns had the same record, 55-27, though Rockets were placed a seed higher. The Rockets were 5th seed &amp; Suns were 6th.

Utah had the 4 seed despite Phoenix &amp; Houston having a better record, b/c Utah won their division. This meant 3 games seperated the 6th seed &amp; the 1st seed.

If the playoffs were just an 8 team tournament featuring the highest Win%, Boston, 66-16, &amp; Detroit, 59-23, would have the top 2. The other 6 spots would all be West teams.

The 38-44 Sacramento Kings, had they played in the East, would've made the 8th seed. On top of that, Golden State missed the playoffs by 2 games. If they were in the East, they'd have the 4 seed.

At the time, Golden State had the highest win% for a non-playoff team since the 8 team playoff format. This was tied by the 2013-2014 Phoenix Suns.

Every Playoff team in the West had at least 50 wins.

Finally, despite all of this, Boston beat Los Angeles for the NBA Championship.

Is there any other season that showed how lop-sided talent &amp; competition was than 07-08?",Has any season shown more of a talent &amp; competition gap than the 2007-2008 season?

"After watching Wizards let Embiid score 10 straight when the game was tied with 3 mins left, I was dumbfounded to see lineup:

ish Russ Beal Bertans and Bryant.

Clearly it is BBQ Chicken for Embiid. I was not surprised that Sixers dominated the rest of the game w 4/5 players half the size of Embiid and Simmons.

I get why Brooks left the team on the floor. It's the lineup that led the comeback. But that's the thing. They needed offensive fire power for any come back.

But with 3 mins left, 10 possessions left at most, you gotta play defensive players. It's a more conservative strategy to try to prevent the offense scoring in last 10. Take it possession by possession.

Embiid is the best center in the league. But the Wizards made it easy for him to score. They should have put in Lopez for Bertans and potentially do offense and defense rotations.","In a close game in the 4th, less than 5 points either way, it's more important to make stops with limited possessions left"

"New Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith joins The Woj Pod to discuss transforming his fandom into buying franchise, arriving along with Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert extension talks, leveraging NBA platform for social equality and charity and translating success of his tech empire into Jazz culture.

You can listen to, or download, their conversation on this link: https://traffic.megaphone.fm/ESP6909522314.mp3","Utah Jazz's owner, Ryan Smith, was a guest on ""The Woj Pod"""
"If Doc sends Austin a message tonight saying ""good game son"" is that legally tampering? If he tweets it will he get fined? What if he said something like ""wow good shooting wish some of my guys in Philly had that kinda hot hand!"" Is that stepping over the line? Seriously guys just looking for answers thanks",Tampering question
"Allen was definitely the best center in tonight's game, even though he was matched up against 2x DPOY and $200mil contract star center Rudy Gobert. He was spectacular both offensively and defensively, holding the Jazz to only 21/50 (41%) shooting from inside the 3pt arc, adding 3 steals and 2 blocks, all while only having 1 personal foul. The Jazz didn't lead once for the entire game and the Nets easily blew them out by 34, even without KD.
  
On the other side, Gobert had 10 points and 11 rebounds on 3/10 shooting. Tough nights happen, but it was very impressive how Allen was able to outperform a star center on both ends of the floor. He has a bright future.  
  
EDIT: Allen also had a mean poster right over Rudy, and both of his blocks came against Gobert himself at the rim.","Jarrett Allen matched up against 2x DPOY Rudy Gobert: 19 points, 18 rebounds on 8/9 shooting"
"From Seth Partnow's [recent Athletic Article](https://theathletic.com/2298827/2021/01/05/stephen-curry-points-warriors-joel-embiid-ben-simmons-collin-sexton-cavs/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=curry):

&gt;Prior to Sunday’s career-high 62-point explosion, “What’s wrong with Steph?” seemed like a much more live topic. He seems to quite dispositively have answered the question on his own in the two games since.
&gt;
&gt;That said, it might still be worth a reminder that even for the best players, bad streaks happen. A “bad streak” for Curry saw him open the season with a True Shooting Percentage of “only” 58.3 — still well above league average — on a gargantuan 32.2 usage rate. However, he had made only 18-of-56 3-pointers. Everybody panic!
&gt;
&gt;Except, such a string of rough shooting is … entirely normal. Throughout his career, Curry has had stretches of five consecutive games during which his total 3-point accuracy was 32.1 percent (his mark through five games this season) 48 times, or roughly once every 13 games. In other words, once a month.
&gt;
&gt;It just so happens that because his latest string came in the first five games of a season in which the Warriors’ find themselves bereft of talent — Kelly Oubre’s Golden State career could hardly have started worse, with two good performance lifting his season-long PER from 2.0 to a still unsightly 7.7 — after a long layoff, we were primed for a weekend of overreacting.

So, if you're worried about a player's shooting percentages this early, give them another month or so. It's early in the season.","[Partnow] Even for the best players, bad streaks happen...

Another impressive performance by Jokic despite going into foul trouble early and missing some easy shots. Nuggets improve to 3-4 and Jokic's MVP run has started.,Jokic drops 35/15/6 on 12/20 shooting with 1/1 from 3. Also adds 3 steals and a block.
"There is literally 3-4 guys that could go #1 who are all super prospects.

- Suggs
- Kuminga
- Cunningham 
- Green
- Mobley",Is this the most loaded draft class since 2003?
Wasn’t following basketball ball at the time. Hopefully you guys can provide some insight on this. Context was this question is whether or not Wade or Durant was the #3 behind Lebron and Kobe.,Was Kevin Durant a top 3 player in the NBA from ‘09-‘11?
"I'll preface this by saying I don't get to watch the Sixers much and so don't really know the ins and outs of their game, but I see the take a lot that Simmons and Embiid don't really fit together. We've seen oversized point guard and center duos be successful before like Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq. I know Simmons sucks at shooting, but if they were surrounded by shooters and strong defenders/role players I feel like it could work. Why is there such a lack of faith in their pairing long term?

Edit: I dont mean to imply at all that they are as good as those other duos. Just asking why stylistically it doesnt seem like many people think their games could work together when we've seen similar skill sets matched together before.","If Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq worked, Why Not Embiid and Simmons?"
"With averages of 24.1 Points, 11.7 Rebounds and 11.9 Assists, Jokic has established himself as a prime MVP candidate despite the Nuggets' lackluster 3-4 start. He leads the league in BPM (and VORP) and is second in PER at 31.1 (trailing only  at 31.6).

Despite all this, Jokic boasts a usage rate of only 26.8%, which is the 34th highest in the league. For comparison,  leads the league at 37.3%. This is even stranger when we consider the fact that a traditional big man like Drummond has a usage rate of 29.4%, which ranks 20th in the NBA.

This came as a big surprise to me, as Jokic seemingly affects everything on offense when he's on the court. 

Jokic also has a TS% of 70%, which is 9th in the league

Interesting side note: Jokic also has the the 6th best defensive BPM of 2.5, which is just below . This definitely over rates his defense but perhaps shows he's not a regular season liability on that end.

[Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html)","Despite leading the league in Assists, Assist % and BPM, and being second in PER, Nikola Jokic only has the 34th highest usage rate in the NBA (26.8%)"
"What players do you think would have benefitted the most from playing in a different era because of the style of the game (not the level of competition)? There are so many players of past generations whose talents could have been maximized in another era.

I always think of a guy like Steve Nash whose production skyrocketed after the hand-check rule was made. The current era would fit him perfectly as a floor-spacing, sharpshooting floor general. 

Conversely, I think Kyrie would have feasted in the early-mid 2000s as an ISO scorer with great playmaking abilities.

What do you think?","Who are the ultimate ""played in the wrong generation"" players?"
"People always talk about how Steph Curry is the greatest 3 point shooter of all time, but what about from the midrange and close to the basket? Percentage is part of it, but there is more to it, like who is guarding, when someone makes a shot, like game winners, and whatever else.
Some candidates I immediately thought of.

Midrange: Michael Jordan and Kawhi Leonard

Close: Shaq and Kareem

I’m wondering if the performance of some players is being affected by the absence of fans.     Are players who normally feed off the crowds energy (like Harden) playing worse? Are mentally weaker players (like Luwawu-Cabarrot) making more clutch shots because they’re not rattled by the crowd?,"Do you think some players are playing better/worse because there are no fans? If so, which players?"

"**Rules**

1. Pound for Pound= Size and Weight: In order to make these calculation we will be factoring in players weight and height
2. Era will be considered so all points will be adjusted to per 100 possessions
3. Primetime: Each players best SIX year stretch will be used for this experiment(**This is because legendary players stats tend to go down during the ends of their careers**).

***Size Score***= 1 point per inch in height &amp; 0.5 point per pound in weight

***Size Score/PPG***= Pound-For-Pound score( **The player with the lowest overall score is pound for pound the better score**)

Hey yall, Im a bit new here, but I am going to start posting these nightly recaps for you guys. Lmk what you guys think! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Nightly Notables

&amp;#x200B;

* Donovan Mitchell and D'Angelo Russell each top 30 points for the first time this season
   * A solid outing for Mitchell in a game in which Utah should have one vs the Nets with no KD
   * Interesting early stat: Mitchell PPG in wins 19.7 PPG, in losses 25.0 PPG
   * Russell had his most aggressive game getting to the line 10 times, doubling his season total attempts from the stripe
   * Encouraging to see that performance from DLo for the Twolves

&amp;#x200B;

* Jarrett Allen monster double double in first start of season
   * Nash opted to start Allen over DJ and it worked out great for the Nets with Allen scoring 19 points and grabbing 18 boards over Gobert and the Jazz
   * It will interesting to see how Nash approaches the center position going forward, but this is great looks for Allen owners 

&amp;#x200B;

* Kyle Kuzma and THT are the ones benefiting from KCP injury
   * Interestingly the Lakers have been starting Kuzma in place of KCP's injury and he has seen 30 minutes in each of his last two games
   * Talen Horton-Tucker has seen 20+ in each of these past two games with no KCP as well
   * Both have not done much with these opportunities, but are both options that would not be horrible value plays on DFS if KCP is still out

&amp;#x200B;

* Juancho Explosion
   * Juancho Hernangomez unloaded on his former team with 25 points, shooting 10/14 and 5/8 from three 
   * There is just no way he can keep that play up, but it was fun to watch him catch fire against his old teammates
   * Another old teammate on Denver that got some extended run was Jarred Vanderbilt, the high-motor player saw 23 minutes of the bench and scored 11 points along with 5 boards. Vanderbilt is a great rebounder, so it will be interesting to see if he gets more time as the season continues, Naz Reid only saw 10 minutes as Minn opted to play a little bit smaller

&amp;#x200B;

* Paul George sits out, Kawhi shows out
   * PG was out, so we got a look on how this Clips team will operate without one of there main studs
   * Kawhi had a season high 30 points on shooting 13/22 from the field in 37 minutes, a big bounce back game from Phoenix where he shot 4/21. Leonard also racked up 10 assists which was also a season high, interestingly he is averaging 6.5 APG which would be a career high 
   * Kennard and Batum both topped 35 min with PG's absence as well. Batum scored 21 points which is his season high, but Kennard struggled from the field shooting 3/10

&amp;#x200B;

* Suite Life of Zach and Coby
   * LaVine and Coby combined for 39 points and 80 minutes in last night's comeback dub over the Blazers. Honestly, modest numbers in a sense that either one of these two could explode for 30,40+ on a given night, but these two are going to see a lot of action during this Western conference trip. Sato is out with Covid rules so Coby is seeing all the run at PG and if the Bulls want to stay in games, LaVine needs to be on the court. It will be interesting to see if the Bulls could ride the momentum they have started to brew on this trip out west. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Watch:

Anthony Edwards: Played 25 minutes against the Nuggets which has been pretty on par with is playtime throughout the season, he hoisted up 19 shots, but went 1/7 from three. His 28% from the three is not exactly what you want to see early, but that was his 7th game of his career and he seems like he has the confidence and ability to improve that. Regardless when he is on the floor he is the focal point, his 25.8 usage% is first for rookies playing over 10 min a game, but Melo Ball is very close behind at 25.5%

&amp;#x200B;

Facundo Campazzo: Lol is this guy really counting as a rookie, Facu has started to come into his own these past two games for Denver. He's seen 20+ minutes in each of those games and had double digit outing in each of those games. He only had two assists  in each of those games, but this man is a natural born playmaker, and if Malone keeps giving him minutes, those numbers are bound to rise

&amp;#x200B;

Desmond Bane: Saw 20+ minutes for the 6th time in 7 games although only scoring 7 points , encouragingly in his past 6 games he has shot at least 4 threes a game and is shooting 47% from three on the season. 

&amp;#x200B;

Devin Vassell: Only played 16 minutes last night, but the shooting was on display going 3/4 from three with 12 points. Vassell is playing behind some good talent in SA, but if he is shooting 54%(obviously cannot sustain this but impressive start) from three right now, more minutes should be eventually coming to him. He has also racked up 5 steals over his past three games. The 3&amp;D player he was advertised of at FSU is starting to show it in the league. 

&amp;#x200B;

Patrick Williams: Williams scored 14 points in 24 minutes in Chicago's come back dub. Williams is continuously showing flashes of his high potential. He really won't be the focal point of this offense at all this season, but he is a little bit of everything type of player and is shooting the ball well making him an attractive 9 cat piece.

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the night: Nikola Jokic(35 Pts, 15 Rebs, 6 Asts, 12/20 shooting)

Dud of the night: Demar DeRozan(6 Pts, 5 Rebs, 6 Asts, 3/9 shooting)

Rook of the Night: Devin Vassell(12 Pts, 2 Rebs, 1 Stl, 4/5 Shooting, 16 mins)

Player to target: Facundo Campazzo

An anonymous scout calls the Miami Heat’s 2020 playoff run a 'situational overachievement'

""They were not that good. Butler played out of his mind, Herro played out of his mind, they were all kumbaya, but they were not quite that good.""

(Via ESPN)

As a die hard Heat fan, it erks my brain to see the blatant disrespect we have been receiving from NBA twitter over the last couple of weeks. 

We pulled off an improbable finals run by beating the team with the best record in the NBA, most PPG in the league, as well as the the best DEF rating in the league. Notice how I said TEAM and could care less about the 2x B2B MVP they have as well. 

On top of that we beat a Celtics team that has gone to the ECF the last 3 out of 4 years with Jaylen, Tatum AND a brand new addition in Kemba Walker. 

I understand the “bubble” adds a certain X-factor to the equation that we can’t physically see in terms of data but when are people going to accept that our squad was and is actually great? 

I’ve never been more excited about the future of our team in terms of young talent with a core such as ours ESPECIALLY with the coaching talent we have to groom them. 

I’ve be on vacation from NBA Reddit for quite a bit so I’m not sure what the current consensus is on us, but let me tell you NBA Twitter is a bunch of casuals. It’s time I come back home lol.

The question I have for you all is, what makes everyone think we can’t do the same thing again?",[NBA CENTRAL] An anonymous scout calls the Miami Heat’s 2020 finals run a “situational overachievement”

"So in football there’s a kicker to take all your kicks, which are kinda of like free throws. Ofcourse no fouls lead to the kick, but nonetheless there are designated positions for that.

What if players like JJ redick or Jose Calderon could be signed for the sole purpose of making fts.

The points should still count for the player who took the beating in the first place because I know James Harden won’t be happy if 10 points get take away from his 34 ppg. 

The FT shooters themselves can be judged on FT’s made and FT’s attempted, no need for points. 

There is also the chance for increased foulbaiting because it’s more assured points, but to change that, what if these FT positions for every 4th foul your worst free throw shooter takes two. Therefore you’ll want to avoid, especially in the 4th quarte, the chance of your worst free throw shooter taking the game winning FT’s.

Dumb idea, but also pretty creative imo",What if teams could sign FT positions?
"Hi everyone, if this has been brought up before, this can be taken down. I was thinking a little bit this morning on what Adam Silver mentioned the other day about expansion and what would be needed to expand the league. But my question to you all is this...

Could a group of fans ( for Seattle or Las Vegas or some other city) create an investment group of fans like the Green Bay Packers have and make it work in the NBA? 

The idea would be the fans own the team, most likely a shareholders group run the team, but ultimately the team would be owned by the fans. Could this be done in today’s era, and what would be needed to make this happen besides money? 

While this might be a silly idea, I am curious to know honest and open ideas and how to make it work.",Fan owned team in the NBA?
"I think that the NBA has a lot of good choices for expansion and I'll put it in a list.

1.) Bring in Seattle and St. Louis/Kansas City

They should have never gotten rid of Seattle and no other teams are in Missouri.

2.) Bring Seattle and Vancouver and move Pelicans or Grizzlies to the east.

This is logical because Memphis and Louisiana are both in the east and west kind of and you could move either/or. Adding Vancouver could be a good way to bring the NBA more international.",IDK where to post this but I'll put this here and if it gets taken down so be it.
"There are many arguments on here like “KD is the most skilled player” or “Giannis is not skilled enough from a talent standpoint, his success is all predicated on athleticism.”

Has the word “skill” become synonymous with shooting? Think of the most skilled players in the NBA in your opinion. Almost all of them are good shooters, and for good reason as shooting is an important list.

Now ofcourse there are multiple more skilled players than Giannis, but to group him, Ben Simmons, and Westbrook into this “all athleticism minimal skill” seems wrong, no?

Like Giannis may not be the upper echelon of skilled *players*, but for *big men* he might just be.

Better passer than everyone except Jokic. Sabonis and Bam are arguable. Elite defensive IQ. His handles are probably the best in the game for a pf. Has numerous types of finishes, etc.

All of this applies to Ben Simmons too.

Is shooting too reflective of “skills” now?",Has “skilled” become synonymous with good shooter?
"He's looked pretty rough offensively these few games. He's currently averaging 8.5 ppg on 30% fg. He was real solid last year offensively too, He was putting up 16ppg on 40% from three on 5 attempts a game and had a 50% fg. Hoping he can turn it around soon, he's a super solid player.",What has happened to Norman Powell?

"The 2019-2020 Sixers were 31-4 at home (73 win pace) and 12-26 on away games (26 win pace). This made them one of the lost lopsided teams I’ve seen in a long time. At home, these guys were the 2016 Warriors, but during away games they always looked off, be it body language, shooting, etc. 

What contributed to such a wide disparity in play, and are there any other teams that were like this?","The 2019-2020 Sixers were on a 73 win pace at home, and a 26 win pace on away games. Has any other team had such a lopsided level of play depending on if their home/away?"

Yet he's left-handed in writing. He's naturally born as a lefty but trained himself to be right handed. How come? Wouldn't he dominate even more if he was left handed? I mean look at the MLB. Some stars like Barry Bonds or CC Sabathia are natural righties but play left handed and have been stars that way.,Why is Lebron right handed in basketball?
"My father and I, both avid basketball fans, have an ongoing discussion about starting 5 in a playoff series. Just looking for opinions on who should’ve been chosen over our list.

Me
PG- Curry
SG- Kobe 
SF- Lebron 
PF- Rodman
C- Yao Ming
6- Karl Malone

Dad
PG- MJ
SG- Harden
SF- Bird
PF- Barkley
C- Shaq 
6- Nowitzki

Who would you choose and why? We’ll give our own reasoning on the matchups in the comments

P.S Drinking has been involved in this list so pls take that into account lol. Also we chose to discredit injuries and such. 

Edit- we couldn’t choose the same players, this is all about matchups, we also chose a 6th man over a substitute",Starting 5 in playoff series (All Time)
Title. I liked him as a player and he's a cool guy also. I even bought a red shirt inspired by when he was on GQ. But in Orlando and even more so now his stats look rough out there. I haven't seen many Raptors games after Kawhi and JV (I'm Lithuanian lol) left and that's why I'm asking :),What's up with Siakam?

"This is probably something that is probably best answered by “just start watching” but I want to shoot anyway. I am new to watching sports. I love playing them, but never really was a big spectator. I recently started watching NBA and I have really enjoyed learning about the individual teams. The problem is, the NBA is so BIG. It’s hard to follow all the trades, wins/losses, who is healthy etc. I want to follow a team (the closest one for me would be the Grizzlies), but I still want to understand the many different things that happen outside of one franchise. How do you do it?",How did you get into watching the NBA?
"Who are your new sleepers for the playoffs? Is a certain hyped up player really just a washed bum riding a high? Who is looking like a legit 6MOY? Should Christian Wood's nickname be ""The Cross""? Are the Raptors making the playoffs? Will Julius Randle's legs survive Thibs? Is Jokic your regular season MVP or Finals MVP? Will the All-Star celebrity game be played on 2K? Go off nephews.","A few games into the season, what are your new hot takes?"
"They had Gobert there thrice getting his ass handed to him but not the dagger from Zach. 

Even I didn't notice it until I read the comments from some angry Bulls fans. Has this been a common theme? 

You can watch the video here:  [Top 10 plays of the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkE1UufhFx4)",The NBA top 10 plays on their YouTube channel didn't feature Zach Lavine's dagger.
"
Any player surprised you being (or not being) on the list? Anyone surprisingly high or low? Which U-25 players have a chance to reach top50 in the future?

"It's a short sample size, but do you think Harrell was a good addition to the Lakers? I personally don't see how adding a huge defensive liability at the forward/center position can be considered a solid addition for a defense first team, even if he has scoring punch. 

The Lakers' defense in general just looks mediocre

What do you think?",Was Montrezl Harrell a good acquisition for the Lakers?
"Today I am going to discuss 25 players who are improving dramatically and whose stocks are rising.

**() Overall Rank**

**1 Jaylen Brown (25)**

I expected Brown to be solid but nobody expected this. Just 8 games into this season he has cracked my top 25 for the 1st time in his career while averaging over 26 PPG on over 57% shooting. Kendrick Perkins has been a huge supporter, going as far to say that he is better than Jayson Tatum. That's overboard but at this rate he is a shoe-in for his 1st all-star appearence.

**2 CJ McCollum (28)**

McCollum has always been considered one of the better 2nd options in the league, but he has taken his game to the next level so far. His solid play has already put him in serious consideration for his 1st all-star appearance with over 27 PPG on over 43% shooting from 3 while shooting a ridiculous near 12 3's a game. It is yet to be seen whether he can keep up this insane production throughout a whole season and I have my doubts but if he were to continue at this rate we could potentially be talking even all-NBA level.

**3 Tobias Harris (32)**

Harris has been one of the most efficient scorers in the league for one of the best teams in the NBA. Rivers has given major praise to Doc Rivers so far and the coaching change seems to have done wonders for his game. Shooting over 47% from 3 with a career-best 22.6 PER so far, Harris is inching closer to equaling the value of his max contract right now at least.

**4 Malcolm Brogdon (38)**

Brogdon is probably the most under-the-radar player on this sub right now. He has established himself as one of the best point guards in the East (I currently have him 4th) and has great efficiency while having a career-best year in terms of advanced defensive statistics. He's also shown a knack for clutch plays, hitting a game winner against New Orleans.

**5 Collin Sexton (41)**

Dwyane Wade gave praise to him yesterday, and Sexton is quickly establishing himself as a potential consistent all-star talent starting in 2022. He is able to give you 20 points in his sleep and is shooting over 55% from the field in 7 games while leading Cleveland to a winning record.

**6 John Wall (53)**

Modern medicine is amazing and Wall is proof of this. While not in elite status anymore, similar to Derrick Rose, Wall is proving that he provides value still.

**7 Joe Harris (70)**

Harris has fit in well with the now star studded Nets, shooting over 51% from the 3 so far and looks to be a key piece looking to contend.

**8 Myles Turner (71)**

Turner is low-key on pace to potentially have the best season of his career, shooting over 70% inside the 3 while averaging an insane 3.6 BPG so far. He's shooting more 3's and if his efficiency from there can improve, he could be a top 50 player by season's end.

**9 Julius Randle (76)**

I'm skeptical if the Knicks can keep up this level of success the whole year but Randle's career-best play so far cannot be denied. He's improved in all areas, even defense where he is a plus defensive player for the 1st time in his career. 

**10 Christian Wood (78)**

Wood is quickly moving up my overall list at this rate. He's drawn praise from James Harden and has quickly become a favorite on this sub due to his perseverance in overcoming adversity.

**11 DeJounte Murray (79)**

Murray's game is limited by lack of 3-point-shooting but he does everything else well for a point guard and has nice size. His scoring load has increased by about 30% from the previous season and has come up big in games such as 21 points in a win vs. the Clippers last night.

**12 Mike Conley (87)**

Conley's 1st season in Utah was a disappointment, but so far this season he is starting to change the narrative on him. With solid averages of 18.6 PPG, 5.0 APG, and 4.1 RPG, Conley is proving that he can still be effective as he enters his mid-30's.

**13 Jordan Clarkson (94)**

Clarkson has turned into one of the more underrated scorers off the bench in the league. He is currently averaging 15 PPG on career-best efficiency and has cracked my top 100. He just needs to stop pushing refs.

**14 Seth Curry (98)**

Seth has now cracked my top 100 for the 1st time ever. He is the x-factor behind Philly's success and is averaging over 15 PPG on over 54% shooting from 3 and Seth has not missed a free throw this year. 

**15 Terrence Ross (108)**

I don't think anybody expected Ross to average nearly 21 PPG so far. He has career-bests 41% from 3 and a 20.8 PER. If he continues playing at this pace, he will move into the top 100 quickly.

**16 RJ Barrett (116)**

Barrett has become a dangerous weapon and despite not being drafted to the greatest situation, he is inching closer to a top 100 spot in his 2nd year. However, he is one of the worst 3-point-shooters in the league currently and that needs to improve.

**17 Markelle Fultz (128)**

The eye test shows clear improvement and he has moved up on my list a tiny bit from last year, but his shooting efficiency has regressed. There's a lot to like still, the athleticism is incredible and his playmaking has improved. But the progression of his shooting will determine whether he will be a clear top 100 talent or a more athletic Elfrid Payton.

**18 Mikal Bridges (138)**

To go along with being a favorite of defensive analytics, Bridges is also shooting over 46% from 3 so far this year. Unquestionably, the addition of Chris Paul has helped Mikal continue to progress and at this rate he will be near the top 100 by the end of the year.

**19 Deandre Hunter (148)**

Hunter's reviews after his rookie year were really not good, but he's showing why he was picked 4th overall in his 2nd year. Hunter's offensive game has developed as he is currently shooting over 48% from 3 while averaging nearly 16 PPG. He still has a little bit to go before top 100 after a bad rookie year, but he's looking good.

**20 Avery Bradley (192)**

Bradley's role wasn't expected to be as big as it was but he's taking advantage, averaging 13 PPG on 59% shooting from the field and over 52% from 3. It's only been 5 games but Bradley is looking promising so far.",20 Players Progressing Rapidly

They've been using a number of other people to voice the high lights but they don't make rhymes or do the topten thing at the end.",What happened to the NBA Top Ten guy?
"Hey all, big time NBA fan here. 

I follow basketball on all of my social media platforms. I can’t get enough of it. The personalities of the players, the athleticism, showmanship, teamwork, the statistics, and especially the camaraderie between players on the courts which is really quite beautiful to see so many talented people being able to share their passion and talents with one another, much like when artists collaborate. On top of it all, the NBA in particular is lead gloriously by Commissioner Adam Silver, who has proven how deeply empathetic and intelligent he is since taking over the league. He is a stand up guy, a person who everyone can look up to in how he handles social issues and impossible tasks. Look how he handled The Bubble. Crazy. What I’m trying to get to is that Adam Silver seems to care about people. And he cares about the players. He’s embraced the idea of players around the league opening up about mental health issues, and seems to focus more on their well beings than business operations, which is very unlike many people ‘on top’. With all this being said, it would seem that the rest of the NBA community would share the same empathy for human beings. 

When I read articles and basketball news, I like to read the comments to see how others are thinking (why I still do this, I don’t know). I’m met with TOP comments full of unnecessary hate, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and blatant disrespect towards other commenters and especially the players. Some of these comments are obvious trolls, but others are sincere and I’m baffled how anyone can say some of these things about other human beings. The PG interview last night where he explained how he hasn’t felt this much hate from the community in his 10 years in the league is sad. 

The WNBA page is the worst. Every comments section is riddled with hurtful things about women having no place in basketball, how they should “get back in the kitchen”, and how they’re just plain “boring” to watch. This is their passion. Their life. They’ve dedicated themselves to this life of hard work and training and you’re grading them as “boring”.

I don’t care for the argument “ehh they have no place to whine, they’re millionaires”. A lot of these players are good people with good hearts. They help their communities and donate to charities. They have families. They have humility. They’re human beings. 

Imagine if you dedicated your entire life to your passion only to have strangers screaming in your face, cursing you out, and narrating your reputation on the internet about the flaws in your passion. Wouldn’t feel very good, would it? 

We can be better, basketball community. There’s a fine line between competitive spirit and being an arrogant ass.",The NBA community should not be this toxic.
"The teams in the bubble had the shortest offseason ever and the teams that didn't had the longest. Obviously the teams that made the bubble were better in the first place, but relative to where they were expected to be this season: are the teams that were in the bubble overperforming or underperforming? 

Knicks are way ahead of where I thought they would be and it looks like some of the guys really took the long offseason to work hard and came in in great shape. Haven't watched a lot of the rest of the league to get a feel if that's a wider trend though.",Was being in the bubble a handicap or advantage for teams coming into this season?

"*assume both of these young stars sustain good performances*

Domas is easily the better passer. He’s probably the 2,3,4 best passing big man in the league. Both of them are relatively shot on defense, but Domas blocked a Boogie poster!

Randle is probably the better shooter, as however much Domas improved, Randle has reached god tier on efficiency.

At Rim: 58% vs 77%

3-10 ft: 41% vs 30%

10-16 fr: 52% vs 0%

Context: The Cavs signed 6-foot-9 power forward Dean Wade in July of 2019, and the 24-year-old is now in his second season with the squad. 

Dwyane took a shot at himself in his remark, noting how he had a rather forgettable stint with the Cavs. The former 13-time All-Star played just 46 games for Cleveland during the first half of the 2017-18 season. The Cavs eventually traded him to the Heat in exchange for a second-round pick. In his brief tenure as a Cavalier, Dwyane averaged 11.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists in 23.2 minutes per contest.

What do you think Duncan Robinson’s free agency value is so the 21’ FA class? And what player and contract does it compare to?,Duncan Robinson FA Value?
"Do you see that lineup as a bonafide contender if Phoenix had taken Luka?  

They would be in prime position to compete for the next decade easily.  

Booker/Luka are 2 bonafaide #1 options at their current age.  You can't say that about a lot of other teams in the league.

Current teams that have a duo of All NBA guys are

- Lakers 

- Nets

- Clippers",Luka/Booker/CP3 -- What Could've Been?
"Free throws are not taken during the regulation game time.  They accumulate throughout the game and then after regulation both teams take their free throws.  If the score difference at the end of the game is such that the losing team still can't win if they make all their free throws and the winner misses theirs, then the free throws are just skipped.  

This will have the following benefits on the game:

* Eliminate flopping because you won't get the stoppage and free throws immediately.  And your might not get them at all depending on the points you got from normal shots.  Points from normal shots become much more valuable.
* Eliminate intentional fouling at the end of the game.  It does nothing for you now.


This will fix a lot of the problems that the NBA has.",[Discussions] Ideas to eliminate flopping and reduce game stoppage
"What's crackin. *Proof\_Tadpole* is back with another ranking list. We went over point guards, so today we are going over the top 10 small forwards entering the 2020-2021 NBA season. Gonna keep this intro short and sweet.

Note: This is a personal opinionated ranking of the small forwards I think would have a good 2020-2021 season. This is not to be considered as fact. I would also like to mention that with how the game is being played (positionless basketball), what you might think is a small forward, might not be a small forward for me (I would also like to let y'all know that my shooting guard post flopped a lot because of my ranking, which I take the blame for. I would like to thank y'all for the criticism, as it helps me improve on how I see basketball. At the end of the day, we are all fans of the game, and all of your opinions help me to better understand this wonderful game So once again, thank you, and hopefully this list can be somewhat of a come back). So if we disagree, I would like to let y'all know that our definitions are different, and that is okay; we just have to agree to disagree. Also shoutout to Andy Hoops for the inspiration. With that being out of the way, let us begin.

1. Lebron James- This is a no brainer. Like I could just leave it at that, but y'all know I am not going to do that. Last year, The King averaged 25.3 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 34.8% from the field on 6.3 attempts per game (which was the most threes he shot per game in an entire season). He also grabbed 7.8 rebounds a game and lead the whole league in assists at 10.2 assists per game, and ended up placing second place in MVP voting (which he seemed to have a problem with, as he tweeted out ""Only 16 First Place votes"" with 3 laughing emojis. He also said in an interview that he was pissed off about the MVP voting). He then turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 27.6 points on 56.0% shooting from the field and 37.0% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. He played out of his mind in the finals, averaging 29.8 points on 59.1% from the field and 41.7% on 6.0 attempts per game, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game. These numbers and the well coached Lakers team overcame the Heat in 6 games to bring the Larry O'Brian back to Los Angeles, and he was awarded finals MVP for his performance (which was a no brainer), where he said that he finally wanted his ""damn respect"", which he earned based off the performance he had in the playoffs. This season, I expect the Lakers to repeat as NBA champions, and I expect Bron Bron to lead the way (although, I do not expect them to get that top seed like they did last year, as I expect them to cruise through the regular season, and turn it up an notch in the playoffs, where I expect Bron to do most of his damage). At the end of the day, Bron is the best small forward and best player in the league, no doubts about that pick.
2. Kevin Durant- The reason why this list is coming out a little late was because I wanted to see some games from KD. Although the Nets record might be looking a little suspect (besides the first couple of games, that defense is cracking), KD's play has been phenomenal. In 6 games, the mans is averaging 28.2 points on damn near 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% from the field and 45.5% from three on 5.5 attempts per game), 7.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists. Add to that he looks really good (like the achilles tear never happened. Like bro looks like he got new bunnies) and his effort on the defensive end is also there, so he is well on his way to making a full recovery. And even if you didn't want to take in these stats because of the sample size, lets travel back to the 2018-19 season, where the slim reaper averaged 26.0 points on 52.1% shooting and 35.3% shooting from three on 5.0 attempts per game, bringing down 6.4 rebounds, and dishing out 5.9 assists per game (which only earned him an All-NBA Second Team selection). He then turned it up to a whole other level in the playoffs, averaging 32.3 points on 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% shooting from the field, 43.8% from three on 6.7 attempts per game, and 90.3% from the line on 9.3 attempts from the charity stripe), grabbed 4.9 boards and had 4.5 assists a game, before the strained right calf he suffered in the Houston series. He was the game changer in the NBA Finals, as he returned for Game 5 when the warriors were down 3-1. He scored 11 points in the first quarter, however, while trying to post up Ibaka, he ended up suffering an achilles tendon injury (which honestly doesn't seem to bother him at all). I have high expectations for the Nets, as I expect them to compete in a rather stacked Eastern Conference, and I expect KD and Kyrie to lead the way for them to reach their potential.
3. Kawhi Leonard- Mr. Terminator finds himself at the number 3 spot for obvious reasons.  In the 2019-20 season, Kawhi averaged 27.1 points on 47.0% shooting from the field and 37.8% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.1 rebounds and dished out 4.9 assists per game. He also played great defense (but not to the level that the media and a lot of fans were hyping it up to be, as he had to spend more time and energy on the offensive side of the glass, as the mans was a very integral part of the Clippers offense). His performance on the court rightfully earned him a second team all-NBA selection and a second team all-defense selection. The only problem with Mr. Leonard was that of his load management issues, as people outside of the Clippers bubble thought that this action of his would eventually bite him the back, as they speculated that the team would not have any proper chemistry with each other with the limited amount of games and practices that Kawhi would have with the other players (add that with the fact that Paul George was coming off that shoulder surgery, so the team really could not gel well with one another). The Clippers did seem to have a hot hand around February, but that momentum was squashed when the pandemic hit. Fast forward to late August in the bubble, and wouldn't you have guessed it, the Clippers are struggling in the playoffs. They barely beat Luka and the Mavs in 6 games, got up 3-1 against the Nuggets, and then forgot how to play basketball, as they ended up blowing that 3-1 lead and the series. Now, we all know Paul George wet the bed, but half of the blame is to be put on Kawhi as well (especially with that game 7 shooting, like my god). The stats may show you one thing (as he had good playoff numbers), but the eye test shows you something completely different (like, this was the first time I felt Kawhi was just out of it). But regardless, the past is in the past, and with the additions of Ibaka and Luke Kennard, I still have this team in contention in the west. Now, it is very likely they are not getting past the Lakers, but if they end up seeing them in the playoffs, I expect that to be a good series. So overall, got some pretty solid expectations (I guess more grounded than last year) for Kawhi, and hopefully he can bounce back and forget the disaster that was the 2020 playoffs.
4. Jimmy Butler- Imagine if Rock Lee from Naruto or Asta from Black Clover were an NBA player; you got yourselves Jimmy Butler. He essentially had nothing from the start, but through hard work, dedication, and a killer mindset, was able to go from a 30th overall draft pick who was seen as a glue guy coming off the bench for his defensive skills (so somewhat like Marcus Smart, side note: not hating on Marcus Smart), to a max player and leader of the team that earned their spot in the NBA finals. Coming into the 2019-20 NBA season, Butler was viewed as a locker room cancer and a player that was ""uncoachable"", which lead to a lot of people questioning his decision to sign with the Heat (as he was viewed as a person who wanted to win, but he left the situation he had in Philadelphia, a team that was a couple bounces away from going to overtime with the Raptors, and possibly going to the NBA Finals). A lot of people outside Miami slept on the heat, saying that they would just be a fringe playoff team, and that the signing of Butler was just so that they could put seats in the American Airlines Arena. But straight off the rip, the Heat ad Butler surprised many. Although Butler's 19.9 points on 45.5% shooting and 24.4% shooting from three on 2.1 attempts per game does not look like that of a player belonging on a top 5 spot, the intangibles he brings to the game is what sets him apart from other superstars (and yes, he is a superstar). He had a career high 6.0 assists and 6.7 rebounds per game, to go along with 1.8 steals per game (which truly does not depict his defensive value, as he is such an amazing defensive player, and the leader of that strong Miami defense along with Bam Adebayo). Even after the stellar regular season, a lot of people were still sleeping on the Heat, saying that they would be a second round out at best. However, in the NBA playoffs, Miami and Butler turned up the heat (pun intended). Despite his playoff numbers not being that eye-popping (22.2 points on 48.8% shooting from the field and 34.9% shooting from three on 2.0 attempts per game, 6.5 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.0 steals a game), Butler always kept the Heat in check, and always set the tone for what was one helluva finals run. He went off in the NBA Finals, averaging 26.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game on 55.2% shooting from the field and 30.8% from three, pushing the Lakers to 6 games, despite loosing Goran Dragic and Bam for the majority of that series, and proved to everyone on the planet that he was a winning player, rightfully squashing all of his negative baggage that came with him. Although the Heat seem to be struggling to start off the season (which is expected as they are coming off the shortest off-season in NBA history), I expect them to figure themselves out by the middle of the season, and I expect them to be the same dark horse (because I am just gonna keep it a bean, the Heat are legit), and I expect Jimmy to lead this team, hopefully for another deep playoff run (I really hope this man can get a ring. I loved him on the 76ers, and I was sad that we didn't choose to resign him, but I am happy that he is in a better situation now. Hopefully he don't get that Rock Lee treatment, cuz they did him dirty in Naruto. But like no cap, he do be like Asta doe. Like everyone hated on him, now everyone understands his struggles and appreciates him. Dubs in the comments if you a Black Clover fan, cuz we getting recognized).
5. Jayson Tatum- If Butler is a combination of Rock Lee and Asta, then I guess Tatum think he Deku cuz he thinking that the ""Mamba Mentality"" is like one for all (I know it is corny, and I am so sorry. But for real though, Tatum do be thinking he Kobe, which is not a knock against him, but still. Also, Deku's associated with Green and Tatum on the Celtics, so that reference is hopefully not completely off). Ignoring the corny ass anime reference (which hopefully at least one of y'all get), Tatum is without a doubt a budding star (hell, he is a borderline superstar at this point), and last season was officially his breakout year. In the 2019-20 season, Taco Jay averaged 23.4 points on 45.0% shooting from the field and 40.3% from three on 7.1 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.0 rebounds and dished out 3.0 assists, which earned him the accolade of third team all-NBA. He also contributed to a very elite perimeter defense that was in Boston, and grew to becoming the leader of that young Celtics team. Like Butler, Tatum turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 25.7 points on 43.4% shooting from the field and 37.3% from three on 7.4 attempts per game. He also grabbed 10.0 rebounds and dished out 5.0 assists a game, leading the C's to the Eastern Conference Finals, and were two games away from making the NBA Finals. So far into the young season, Tatum and the Celtics have been looking very good despite that rocky start to the season. This season, I expect the Celtics to take another step in the right direction and to see growth from both Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum (like, I know he grew more into a leader last season, but it always felt like he put up the stats, and guys like Brown, Smart, and Walker were the leaders of that team). I expect him to make an all-NBA, all-Defense (which he was lowkey snubbed for last season), and possibly get some MVP votes.
6. Paul George- I want to preface this by saying that this is not a knock against Mr. Playoff P. We all know that Paul George is going to be great in the regular season (I mean, mans right now is playing like an MVP Candidate, averaging 25.1 points on 50.8% shooting from the field, 49.2% shooting from three on 8.7 attempts per game, and 92.9% shooting from the charity stripe. He is also dishing out 5.1 assists and grabbing 5.7 rebounds per game. He also seems to have a better start with this Clippers team as opposed to last year, as he knows his role on the offensive and defensive side of the floor). But I am not gonna sit around and not mention the atrocity that was ""Pandemic P"" in last season's playoffs, which is the main reason why he is this far down. In the 2020 playoffs, Paul George averaged 20.2 points on 39.8% shooting from the field and 33.3% shooting from three on 8.5 attempts per game, brought down 6.1 rebounds, and dished out 3.8 assists per game. Basically mans switched from playing like an all-NBA player, to a bench player who was brought into the 15 man roster from the G-league, who is trying his hardest to stay on the team. Again, I am not implying that Paul George is bad (in fact, he is pretty good), but all I want from him is consistency. He needs to prove to the basketball community that he is a reliable option in the playoff, and that he isn't just a regular season player.
7. Brandon Ingram- Last year, Brandon Ingram officially had his breaking out season. After being traded to New Orleans from Los Angeles in the Anthony Davis trade, Ingram was able to flourish in his new playing environment. Although the Pelicans were a pretty underwhelming team (kinda falling sort of expectations I guess), Brandon Ingram did not disappoint, averaging 23.8 points on 46.3% shooting from the field and 39.1% shooting from three on 6.2 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.2 rebounds and dished out 4.2 assists per game, which earned him an all-star selection (also got some high respect from one Kevin Durant, noting that his game was very similar to his, saying that he has potential to be an elite player in this league), and won him the Most Improved Player award (although, I personally felt like it should have went to Bam Adebayo). Despite his statistical growth, he showed a lot of promise on the defensive end of the floor and he was able to be the go-to scoring option for this team down the stretch (basically, him being a jack of all traits player in the beginning of his career, which hurt him, is now pretty beneficial for him now). To start off this season, BI has looked strong, averaging 25.0 points on 44.8% shooting from the field and 38.6% from three on 6.3 attempts per game. He is also flourishing as a playmaker, averaging a career high 5.7 assists per game, while bringing down 6.4 rebounds per game. I expect the Pelicans to make some noise this season, and hopefully BI and Zion can lead this team to promising success in the future.
8. Khris Middleton- (These last three spots were very hard, so please do excuse me if I screw up here and there). Middleton finds himself here at number eight (like he is a good to great player and underrated, but at the same time, it really doesn't feel that way. Like, he is just an all-star player). If I were to just describe him, I guess all I can say is that he is somewhat of a second option to Giannis, in the fact that he scores his 20 points on good efficiency (to be more specific, he averaged 20.9 points on 49.7% shooting from the field and 41.5% shooting from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 6.2 rebounds, and had 4.3 assists per game). He is an above average defensive player and a vocal leader for this Bucks team. He has developed every single year in this tenure with the Bucks, and I expect nothing less from him this season as well (he is already averaging 20 points on 50-40-90 splits, so safe to say that he might end up being an all-star again if he keep this pace). His only problem is that of consistency, as like Paul George, Middleton struggled in the bubble, one of the main reasons why the Bucks were upset against the Heat in the second round. I expect the Bucks to remain competitive, and hopefully Middleton can find a way to solidify his position as the second star of this team.
9. Gordon Hayward- Despite that gruesome leg injury he suffered in the 2018 season and the rocky season he had in 2019, Hayward has relatively bounced back to being a productive starter to a borderline all-star type player. Last season he averaged 17.5 points on 50.0% shooting from the field and 38.3% from three on 4.3 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.7 rebounds and passed for 4.1 assists per game. He did not play a lot in the NBA playoffs, as he was coming off a grade 3 right ankle sprain which he suffered in the first round of the playoffs. He returned in game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, but he saw limited action, and the Celtics were taken out in 6 games. This season with the Hornets (who I really do not know where they will end up in the East), I expect to see increases in Hayward's stats (like as of right now, he is averaging 21.9 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 36.4% from three on 5.5 attempts per game. He is also averaging 5.8 boards a game and 4.4 assists per game). I highly doubt he will make an all-star tea, but I expect him to be some valuable veteran leadership for this young Hornets team.
10. Duncan Robinson- Robinson finds himself at number 10 to wrap up this list. It is pretty simple to explain his game: He is just a sniper bro. Last season, he averaged 13.5 points on 44.5% shooting from three on 8.3 attempts per game (which is crazy). He was integral to the Miami Heat's success, and although he is pretty shaky to start of the season and teams seem to be guarding him a bit tighter (he is still shooting like 41.1% from three), I expect him to good this season again. Him and Bam have good chemistry on those hand-offs by the elbows, so he will definitely get good looks from three. The Heat will make another run for it in the east, and I expect them and Robinson to turn it up when the time comes.

Honorable Mentions:

1. Robert Covington- I was debating between Roco and Robinson for the tenth spot. However, I looked into the Trailblazers roster, and he is playing the power forward this year (which I guess is expected based off his defense), so he is going to be in my power forward list.
2. Tobais Harris- Same thing I said with Roco. He plays heavy power forward minutes for the 76ers, a position that he blossomed in during his tenure with the Clippers under Doc Rivers, so expect to see him in the power forwards list
3. Joe Ingles- Again, very close with Robinson. But I went with Robinson based off how much he provided that Heat team with. The inside-out game plan of the heat was very fun to watch last year.
4. Andrew Wiggins- I do not know what the hell to expect from him at this point. One day he has an efficient game and the next he just bricks everything. He is very inconsistent
5. Michael Porter Jr.- Give him time. Just give him time and he will hopefully be a key piece to that Nuggets team.
6. T.J. Warren- Prayers up for a speedy recovery. That is all.

Well. That is my list. Please do give your opinions in the comments below. Please upvote if you liked the list. Power Forward ranking is on the way. If y'all find my anime references funny, then I guess you can hit me up on [u/Ok-Mycologist-3413](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Mycologist-3413/) to just chat anime. I am gonna start to write more analysis based post on anime rather than the usual polls (like right now, that is all that I have), so if y'all wanna chop it up with some anime, come on by. Anyways, preciate the support and Tadpole out.",Ranking the top 10 Small Forwards entering the 2020-2021 NBA Season
"Proven he could carry a mediocre team to a championship (2003), proven he could coexist with another superstar to win a championship (1999), proven he could consistently play well in the regular season (never missed playoffs, never had a season below 50 wins, two MVPs), had insane longevity (contended for 19 years straight, still a good player when he was old), won a lot of championships (5), coexisted with other stars and never had an ego in letting them share the glory (parker, Manu, Kawhi)

Only thing he hasn’t proven is winning without pop I guess.",Has any superstar proven it more than Tim Duncan?
"The Bulls won 6 titles in 8 seasons with Pippen and he's no doubt a historically great player. But I don't think he had the scoring punch of Wade. I personally rate peak D Wade as a top 15-20 player of all time, top 25 at worst. From 2003 to 2011, he played at an insane level both on offense and defense. I don't think Scottie qualifies as such.","Who do you think was better, peak Dwyane Wade or peak Scottie Pippen?"

"I’ve never played professional basketball, so I don’t know if it’s an actual tactic to pressure the refs to blow the whistle your way more often? Or do players actually believe that they’re fouled on every play and never foul opponents?",Is constantly complaining to the refs a valid tactic? Or just players being competitive?

I feel like I have seen this almost happen many many times but I've never actually seen it happen. So many times guys fall in the paint and there's guys around him jumping for the rebound.,Has a player ever falling down on the court and then another player accidentally jumps on their head?
"In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals. What do you think cause the drastic change in strategy in what were both do or die games?

I know the Clippers are touted as having more offensive options than Toronto had, but there were plenty of raptors that could get their own bucket also in Lowry, FVV, and Siakam... which they all proved in the finals.","In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals. What do you think cause the drastic change in strategy in what were both do or die games?"
"Who you got and why? I got manu as he has a more varied skill set, pass, shoot, defend, size, less quick but more athletic in other ways. Where as parker seems is not as much of a two way player, and was a worse shooter. I watched them solely in the playoffs, but am curious what others think.",Who would have had a better career if they did not play for the spurs Manu Ginobili or Tony parker?
"I know Spain/Argentina/France/Slavic countries all had amazing talent on their roster, but I think we’d be the only non-USA team to field an entire roster of rotation pieces on NBA teams.

- Jamal Murray
- SGA
- Lu Dort
- Andrew Wiggins
- Dhillon Brooks
- RJ Barrett
- Chris Boucher
- Tristan Thompson
- Khem Birch
- Brandon Clarke
- Kelly Olynyk
- Cory Joseph

(Switch in Dwight Powell and NAW for some of the bigs if you want)","If every Canadian in the NBA is on board with playing in the olympics this year, would they be the most talented non-USA team ever?"
"Context:

&gt;Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future. Unlike other major revenue streams such as TV and ticket money, expansion fees are not split with players. Such a haul could mean about $160 million per team, a windfall that could wipe out the massive debt load that's piling up, and that alone has perked interest in the expansion path.

&gt;Considering there might be multiple offers from cities like Seattle or Las Vegas and that the league knows its business and its bidders, that could be a fair projection. But a potential Wolves sale of $1.5 billion or less would mean a correction in the NBA market after a decade of growth.

&gt;The Utah Jazz, who play in a much smaller market than Minneapolis, sold for $1.66 billion last month to tech billionaire Ryan Smith. That is a strong vote of confidence in the continued rise in franchise value -- but it might have been an outlier.

https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30652450/what-potential-timberwolves-sale-means-nba-expansion","[Windhorst] Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future."
"The NBA is already hard enough to watch right now because of the lack of crowds, and now we’re getting players resting on prime time games? It just stinks.

It makes sense for dudes like Demarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant and everyone that recently suffered serious injuries, but it doesn’t make sense to allow young healthy players to sit. Does the NBA just not care about the viewers? 

Maybe the solution is to significantly reduce the amount of games, and I’m okay with it. I’m all for *quality* over *quantity* in this instance. I’m a die hard Cavs fan, but I don’t watch close to every Cavs game because there are so damn many. I don’t think NBA fans would mind not having as many games if they actually got to see their favorite players play.",The NBA seriously needs to do something about resting players.
"I'll start, Wilt Chamberlain (flair checks out); not only was he an athletic freak of nature (most athletic player the sport has ever seen), he actually was very skilled at the game of basketball, he had a great post fade, was very nuanced in the post, and was a disciplined defender. There are some more deeper things i'd like to touch on but this is meant to be more for civil light discussion and not in depth analysis.",Which player has the most misconceptions attached to them?
"So personally I go (of the teams I watch)

"So I heard a lot of stuff on how Levert is a really good player and will be the third star and all that stuff but so far he has looked pretty bad and has a abysmal TS. Now granted this is early and his percentages will might go up but as of now do you think he is overrated?

Just for reference Levert has the exact same TS as Siakam in the 2020 playoffs",Caris Levert so far this season 14.5/3.9/5.5 on 39/29/91 and a 46 TS%. Is he one of the most overrated players/assets in the NBA?

"If someone had told me before Elfrid Payton was drafted that in 2021 he’d have the 10th most triple doubles of all active nba players, I’d have assumed he would be a top 50 player at least by now.

"Kyrie is simply too erratic and unpredictable, as good as he is on the court, he could very well just retire tomorrow with no given reason.

Did he make a mistake in investing his last few years of prime in someone as unpredictable and unreliable as Kyrie?",[Serious] Did Kevin Durant make a mistake of teaming up with the mercurial Kyrie Irving in his pursuit of another ring?
"Rubin had the opportunity to purchase the 76ers in 2011 when he was approached by then-majority owner Ed Snider. Rubin declined and months later joined the bid of Josh Harris and David Blitzer. Rubin is also executive chairman of Fantics.

“I only did it because David Stern told me to do it,” Rubin told Sports Illustrated. “Good owners aren’t buying franchises because they think it’s a good economic deal. They’re buying franchises because they’re a huge fan of the sport and they want to be a steward of that team. If they just do it because of a good economic deal, they’re going to be bad owners.”

Which of your teams and owners are you proud of or wish never happens.  

Tillman is a big inspiration for this, Sarver comes to mind. Reisendorf in 1998 is just unforgiveable .

"You can look at years where maybe one Conference was stacked af, but I don't remember the last time so many teams were enjoyable to watch imo and even if they're not going anywhere are worthwhile and dangerous on paper any given night. 

**The West:** Obviously the Clippers, Lakers, Jazz, Warriors, Blazers, Mavericks, Rockets(with Harden), Nuggets are good watchable teams in the West. The Suns have a really good crew this year too though with CP3/Booker/Mikal/Ayton etc. Obviously the Pelicans are a big attraction with playoff hopes. No one has the Wolves in the running, but a team on paper with DLo, Beasley, Rubio, KAT, Culver, and #1 pick AntEdwards is worth watching. I'd look forward to my Sixers playing them to see those guys, they have two stars and a potential third. The Kings and Spurs aren't *bad*, they have good watchable and interesting players, and when Morant and JJJ returns the Grizzlies are certainly a fun young team. The only team left out is the tanking OKC who at least is interesting in the long run with their haul of picks. That's the entire conference. 

**The East:** We're used to a stacked West, but the East is where things really change. Again, Sixers, Pacers, Celtics, Bucks, Heat, Nets were all obvious standout teams in the Conference. That being said, Orlando made the playoffs last year and is off to a good start, and the Cavs actually have an intriguing rotation with Sexland/Okoro/Love/Drummond and guys like KPJ/Cedi/Nance/McGee as well. I think the Hawks have a legit squad there, they look 10 deep to me when healthy with a young(get it) superstar to lead the way. The Hornets have Rozier/Graham/Hayward/Bridges in the starting 5 and LeMelo is a treat off-the-bench. The Bulls have Zach and Coby making an exciting backcourt, a high pick in PatWill, Lauri, Wendell, etc. The Wizards have a backcourt that can kill you any given night with Rui, Deni, Bertans, Thomas Bryant, etc. They aren't elite teams, but they're certainly watchable and they're not a joke imo. Toronto is struggling, but I'll still give them time to bounce back. They certainly have good players. I've covered everyone except the Knicks who are off to a good start, and Detroit is clearly tanking. I won't pass any judgement on the Knicks yet, but that's 13/15 teams I can confidently look at and like. 

When was the last time in the league where even if I'm being personally picky can look at let's say 25/30 teams and say they have good talent and are truly worth watching? I love where the NBA is at right now, I think so many fans have a reason to be excited about their teams. Almost no game feels like a free win coming into it. I personally really hope the league doesn't expand, because this is special.",Talent Distribution in the League is the BEST it's been in years
"Since guys like Pau Gasol and Tyson Chandler aren’t on a roster, that leaves LeBron, Melo, Korver, and Udonis Haslem as the only players that have been in the league since 2003. And because LeBron was taken 1st overall in the draft ahead of Melo and Korver,  and Haslem wasn’t signed until August, technically LeBron has been here longer than anyone else.

Truly insane that the best player in the league is also the league’s longest tenured.[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_and_youngest_National_Basketball_Association_players#)",LeBron James has actually been in the NBA longer than any other current player
"Obviously, the chances of either one of these individuals making it to the NBA is astronomically low, but I thought this would be a fun post. And G-league counts as ""making it"" in the NBA in this case. 

Julian Newman was ""hyped"" to be a type of scoring phenom, and played against varsity basketball players when he was just in fifth grade. He has a good amount of games of scoring a ton of points, but is quite the selfish player. Moreover, he is listed at just 5 foot 7 inches tall, and that even seems generous.

Rapper Sheck Wes played in basketball but didn't go to college. Despite that, he declared for the 2020 draft and no team picked him up. He's just 6 foot 2 inches tall, but still was able to sign for Paris Basketball in LND Pro B, which is a second tier professional basketball league in France. I couldn't find many videos of him balling, but apparently he's somewhat decentish.

So with all that said, who has the higher chance to make it?","Who has a higher chance of making it in the NBA, Julian Newman or Sheck Wes?"

Looking at this helps separate the 3 point era into 4 chunks.

We've got 80-94 where there was a gradual increase every year after the introduction of the 3 point line.

That blip from 95-97 when the NBA moved the 3 point line in to increase players taking the shot.

98-12 where there were small increases early before starting to plateau.

13-now where we've seen an explosion and substantial increases nearly every year in 3s taken.",Looking at the % of total shots taken from 3 year by year.
"Snippets from a new interview with Bogdan:

&gt; “When the news (of the alleged Bucks-Kings deal) came out, we were like, ‘What the fuck?’” Bogdanovic said during a half-hour phone conversation with The Athletic last week. “I didn’t know what was going on. I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure what was going on.”

&gt; ...while Bogdanovic didn’t clarify much about the Bucks’ involvement and why they appeared to believe he was willing to come their way, he made two other strong viewpoints very clear: **The idea that Antetokounmpo recruited him hard directly was overblown, and he wasn’t pleased at how the Kings be-traded him along the way**

&gt;Yes, you read that right. And in a weird sort of way, Bogdanovic’s made-up word made perfect sense.

&gt; “It’s not the part that you were traded (that bothered him),” he said. “But it’s more like you feel a little be-traded. No one let you know about it.”

&gt; ""I remember (the Kings) called me right after they were talking with Vlade — bla bla — and they said, ‘We still want to be the same team, we still want you to (be on the team). You’re a big piece of it, you’re a big part of it.’ Bla, bla, bla. ‘We want to keep you,’ and all those stories. You know, it just caught me off guard, really.

&gt; When someone breaks that trust level, when someone does that, from that point you don’t believe them anymore, you know?""

&amp;#x200B;

Curry can’t take 31 shots and attempt 19 free throws every game like he did on Sunday, but the Warriors do need him to dominate the ball more than he did in their first five games. Before Sunday, Curry touched the ball in the half court 31 times per 36 minutes, a lower rate than any season since Mark Jackson was still the head coach in 2013-14, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Even his brother, Seth Curry, averaged more half-court touches (33.2), as did 86 other players. That changed on Sunday, as Curry set season highs in total touches (88), half-court touches (44), and time possessing the ball (6.6 minutes).

The Warriors won’t and shouldn’t have Curry do his best James Harden impression by running countless pick-and-rolls and isolations. Taking on such a massive workload wouldn’t be wise for a 32-year-old with a lot of miles on his 6-foot-3, 185-pound body. But they do need a higher-usage version of Curry more often. This would mean having him serve as more of an on-ball creator, while balancing that role with his off-ball brilliance.",Stephen Curry was only averaging 31 touches per game on offense *(before 62 pt game) - less then Seth

"Let’s say the team is historically bad like the Process Era Sixers or the 2012 Bobcats, so they are starting from the ground up. 

Their GM is a Sam Presti-type, who swindles 9 unprotected first round draft picks from the same draft year from 9 Billy Kings - and they all turn into top ten picks, including their own.

Assume their scouting department is competent, and the Draft is neither historically good (1984, 1996, 2003) or historically bad (2000, 2013).

"Context:

&gt;**So with the Milwaukee situation, what was your experience and your side of that whole situation?**

&gt; just couldn’t believe everything was happening like that, you know? Nothing was in my hands, really. When I saw that tweet about the Milwaukee stuff, I really saw it on Twitter. It’s not bullshit. That’s why I felt caught off guard.

&gt;(Before free agency, and soon after the Kings fired former general manager Divac in mid-August), I remember (the Kings) called me right after they were talking with Vlade — bla bla — and they said, ‘We still want to be the same team, we still want you to (be on the team). You’re a big piece of it, you’re a big part of it.’ Bla, bla, bla. ‘We want to keep you,’ and all those stories. You know, it just caught me off guard, really.

&gt;When someone breaks that trust level, when someone does that, from that point you don’t believe them anymore, you know? I think it was unfair a little bit because I didn’t even get a call or nothing (from the Kings) and it was 2 a.m. in my country (when the news broke). I was just confused. I remember waking up the next morning, seeing my phone just blowing up. ‘What was happening? What happened?’ Bla, bla, bla. Ah, you got traded to Milwaukee. I said, ‘Like, how can I get traded (when he’s a restricted free agent)?’

&gt;My agent was explaining the whole summer (that in) restricted free agency, we’re waiting for offers and that’s it, you know? If the Kings don’t want to give us a good offer, (or) they offer me the same money they offered me the last time and they didn’t want to go more than that, or they want me to check the market (that’s fine). They’d talked to my agent about checking the market, and I was fine. And then, that was the deal with the Kings. That’s what my agent told me. And I talked personally with them as well.

&gt;**So if I’m hearing you right, did you stop thinking about Milwaukee at that point because the league seemed determine to make sure that didn’t happen?**

&gt;Yeah, honestly, I didn’t even make a decision about it. It was three days where something is happening and I didn’t even decide nothing, you know? I wasn’t even involved. I wasn’t even involved, and it’s about me — which is crazy.

"For teams, it's the ultimate get out of jail free card in that they don't have to trade assets or pay off the rest of their contracts in the event of buyout or amnesty. For expansion teams, their incentive to get decent players since they're just starting up.

The obvious one for me off the bat is Kevin Love. The Cavs would have to trade draft picks and young players in order to trade Kevin Love. I don't think you can get anything of value for Kevin Love at this point in time. I still think he's a good player but I don't know if he's worth the 30 million that he's making at this point in time.

Al Horford has a good chance of not getting protected. The Thunder have somehow found a way to get first round picks in any circumstance. I just don't know why a team would trade for Al Horford at this point in time due to his age.

Another one is probably John Wall. It really depends on where the Rockets are at that point in time. If Harden is traded and they're rebuilding, Wall could be gone. Most of it depends on how they want to build their roster going forward.

Tobias Harris is a possible candidate. I think Tobi is good but they're basically paying LeBron money for a borderline All-Star in the East. Philly could just use the expansion draft as a way to create cap space to get more depth if needed. This one really hinges on whether Philly believes they can get something of value for him in a trade.

If the Clippers don't get past the second round again, Marcus Morris might not get protected. Marcus Morris is a decent player but paying him $16 million every year until he's 35 feels like an overpay.

What other players fall into this category?","If an expansion draft happens, which teams would take advantage of it by trying to get off bad contracts? Which players are in danger of not getting protected?"
"I was not following the Kings very closely at the time, but I seem to recall the Kings trading Cousins during the 2016-17 season to the Pelicans being a pretty big surprise.

"With 5 minutes 39 seconds remaining in the 4th quarter the Grizzlies were given a 3 second defensive violation.  In every box score/play by play I’ve seen (espn, bballref, nba.com) Dennis Shroder is credited with attempting and making the free throw.  From watching the game I’m almost positive it was actually AD who took that free throw.  If that is the case his totals for the game should be 3-4 FT and 27 total points, not 2-3 and 26 as box scores currently show.  Does anyone have tape of the game and if I’m correct how would I go about letting these stats providers know there is a mistake?",Incorrect Box Score From Last Night’s Lakers/Grizzlies Game
"Is there any good reason why it wouldn't be a good idea to only award FTs to attempts that make it to the rim or if the player is tied up at the rim after a clear path or something. If the ball doesn't hit the rim on a shooting foul, it's a side OB with 14 or 24s on the shot clock. This way, we don't have to change the way in which offensive players use FTs for efficiency, but it will disincentivize the really blatant shot fake 3pt fouls where the shooter literally jumps into the flying defender and flails the ball 20ft away from the rim. I just think that type of foul should only be awarded if the shot was headed for the basket.",A possible way to easily reduce the amount of FT stoppage in modern NBA games

That being said, can we try and compile a list of YouTubers that are your go-to for breakdowns and analysis? They don't have to be doing stuff daily but if I can find a channel or two to help me understand each team, during any given week, it would be pretty helpful.

&gt; Yet while Bogdanovic didn’t clarify much about the Bucks’ involvement and why they appeared to believe he was willing to come their way, he made two other strong viewpoints very clear: The idea that Antetokounmpo recruited him hard directly was overblown, and he wasn’t pleased at how the Kings be-traded him along the way.

&gt; **We (Thanasis and Bogdanovic) are friends. We are friends, you know? I talked with him once monthly, once every two months.

How is your family? Basketball things, we didn’t even talk about it because I know that they are professionals and they respect my professionalism and we never talked about it.

It's not fair for them but I wouldn't be surprised if some players would rather get this season over with before the playoffs anyway.

Toronto has a promising young core. Fred, OG, Pascal (who I still believe in) are all locked up for the long haul. Why not get a chance to draft a superstar with a top 5 pick in a loaded draft? I don't even remember the last time Toronto was in the lottery (which is a compliment.)

"With expansion seeming more and more imminent by the day due to the losses the NBA needs to make up as a result of the pandemic, it is interesting to think about how the NBA will restructure after potential expansion. I've seen a good amount of proposals for realignment, but I believe this plan makes the most sense in terms of travel and historical precedent. This is of course assuming that the cities chosen are Seattle and Las Vegas, which I believe to be, by far, the most likely cities to get a team. Any other city is a long shot and would have to replace Las Vegas. 

The proposal involves 4 divisions of 8 teams in the traditional Western and Eastern Conferences and returns the NBA to a pre-2004 structure. The playoffs would be structured also like pre-2004 in which the division winners take the top 2 seeds, with the next 6 teams being ranked by their record. This gives meaning to the divisions along with encouraging divisional rivalries, which is something that is currently lacking in the NBA. This system also ensures that if the two best teams in a conference are in the same division, they will still have the opportunity to meet in the Conference Finals. The only downside, at least in the first couple seasons, is that both expansion franchises would be in the same division, but this is unavoidable unless Las Vegas is replaced with a city such as Montreal or Louisville.

My idea for the schedule is that each team would play 5 games against all 7 teams in their division (35 games), 4 games against 7 teams in the other conference division and 3 games against the remaining team in that division (31 games), and only 1 game against each team in the other conference (16 games), for the same normal 82 games that the league will never relinquish because of revenue. I'm 99% sure this idea would never be implemented but it's still an interesting concept that would really turn up the heat with divisional rivalries. 5 games against divisional foes would allow for 2 two-game mini-series plus a final meeting for each matchup during the regular season, which ensures that there would be a regular season ""winner"" for each matchup. These 5th games could all take place at the end of the season to make tiebreakers and division title races that much more intense, similar to how the NFL does it at the end of their seasons. I think the best part about this, however, is that it would decrease overall travel, which would better the quality of play and (maybe) decrease the amount of injuries we see.

# Pacific Division (Western Conference)

*This division is the Pacific Division of the pre-2004 NBA along with the addition of Las Vegas. It restores some old divisional rivalries that were broken up by realignment in 2004 such as Lakers-Blazers along with restoring the late 60s expansion trio of Seattle-Phoenix-Portland, who all 3 had multiple classic playoff series between each other during the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Finally, Las Vegas can form a desert rivalry with Phoenix and possibly an I-15 rivalry with the LA teams as well.*

# Southwest Division (Western Conference)

*This is the spiritual successor to the original Midwest Division that existed for 34 years, that pulls every team from the current Southwest Division plus 3 teams from the Northwest that are geographically Southwest. OKC finally is with the teams that they have had memorable playoff series with such as Houston, San Antonio, and Memphis. With Utah moving into this division, it keeps the possbility for a real Jazz-Nuggets rivalry along with strengthening the hatred between Jazz and Rockets fans. Travel would be a bit long from places like New Orleans/Memphis to Utah, but the historical precedent is there for Utah to be in this division (they were in the Midwest from 1979-2004) and New Orleans/Memphis will still have OKC and the Texas teams as close cities.*

Denver Nuggets

Oklahoma City Thunder

Dallas Mavericks

San Antonio Spurs

Houston Rockets

New Orleans Pelicans

# Central Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Central Division of the 90s minus Toronto and plus Minnesota, which will make travel far less tedious for the Timberwolves. This gives them the opprotunity to develop rivalries with teams that actually make sense for them, possibily mirroring NFC North rivalries. Charlotte and Atlanta may not make too much sense in terms of travel for this division, but both were in this division throughout the 90s with Atlanta going as far back as 1970. In my opinion, this historical precedent outweights removing a team like Toronto from the Atlantic and putting them here, given the great playoff series the Raptors have had with current divisional rivals (BOS, PHI) in recent years.*

Minnesota Timberwolves

Detroit Pistons

# Atlantic Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Atlantic Division pre-2004 with the addition of the Raptors. I don't think breaking up the Southeast Division is too big of a deal given that Atlanta doesn't really have animosity towards Miami or Orlando that I know of. This also re-introduces the possbility for another Heat-Knicks rivalry one day which would be great for the league.*

Ultimately, this turned out to be a legendary performance. Some of you may remember back when the Western Conference really *did* make it impossible for you to succeed. The San Antonio Spurs were just as good as that extraordinary Kobe-Shaq Lakers team in some ways and also one of the best teams in the league for more than a decade. That ultra gritty, slowly grind your spirit into the ground type of culture was fueled by Duncan, Parker, and Ginobli, but was captained by a prime Gregg Popovich. They happened to come up against the Phoenix Suns in the 2010 playoffs and it would be no easy task, especially at the end of Game 3.

"That draft class was the 1970 class, which included the legends **Bob Lanier**, **Pete Maravich**, **Geoff Petrie**, and **Dan Issel**.

Surprisingly enough, this draft class followed the year when Kareem-Abdul Jabber got drafted, so true situational irony where the the best offensive draft-class occurred after arguably the GOAT. 

Other years with multiple 20+ ppg scorers:

Year | Players 
:- | :-
1960 | Oscar Robertson, Jerry West 
1965 | Rick Barry, Billy Cunningham
1966 | Dave Bing, Lou Hudson
1970 | Pete Maravich, Bob Lanier, Geoff Petrie, Dan Issel

1975 | David Thompson, World B Free

1984 | Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley
**Lottery Era** | **Players**
1985 | Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone
1996 | Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson

Not many surprising names on there, but it is surprising there are only two draft classes to produce more than 2 20+ ppg scorers.  It’s also surprising how after the lottery was introduced, everything changed to such an extent. It’s pretty mind-boggling.

Also keep in mind there’s many players right now who would fit these categories, but I decided to leave them off because their careers are not finished yet.

"I’m watching the Minnesota game and Denver just committed some sort of violation. I didn’t know what it was because I didn’t hear the whistle, I only saw the Denver players complaining in in unison and the ball switched sides.

I also noticed this happening sometimes in the Nets game, where I had to judge based off the player’s reactions, not the whistle.

Is this happening to anyone else? Might be because the synthetic crowd noises and music on the court are crazy loud.",Are the referees audible?
"If Seattle gets a team what does that mean for record books? And can they be named SONICS?

With Okc still in league, anyone have a good guess or a real answer on what would happen?

I think they would have to change their name and not be considered champions. I’m from Oregon would be great to get the PNW rivalry going. 

Thanks in advance",If Seattle gets a team what would that mean for the record books.
"As a new fan, I find it difficult to enjoy games and therefore feel less likely to watch future games. After watching the NBA for around 6 months, I find it very difficult to enjoy the game when I feel like the rules are arbitrary and difficult to understand in real-time.

I started watching the NBA after getting laid off from my banking job soon after the bubble restart. While I quickly picked up another job, I found that I wouldn't start until April and therefore had a significant amount of time for new hobbies. I quickly dove into the NBA and NHL to fill what previously was 100+ hour work weeks, watching every game I could and trying to understand as much as possible. 

Over the last 6 months, I have thoroughly enjoyed the bubble format of the NBA. The Lakers became my favorite team because of their lockdown defense (I'm currently enjoying watching the sixers more) and I went from illegally streaming games to paying for league pass.

However, I've come to a point where I feel like I should really understand what is a foul and what isn't, but being completely surprised 30-50% of the time a whistle is blown. The problem is two-fold. First, NBA broadcasts rarely show replays of fouls. While I understand there is significant fluidity to the game, it makes it difficult as a fan to come to see what is going on at a speed that I can digest it. Also, it makes it difficult to learn and understand the game as a fan. In contrast, the NHL shows replays of almost every penalty, and while there are still controversies, I feel like I can get a better understanding of the game and that rules are more fairly applied.

Tonight I had significant difficulty understanding and watching the lakers/grizzlies games due to the aforementioned issues. As a new fan, I find these incongruencies frustrating and am looking forward to the NHL start as a replacement for the NBA product.","The NBA product as a new fan, and why fouls are frustrating"
"Last night, I was watching the second half of the Pacers Pelicans game and I noticed something small I wanted to write about - I saw that the Pelicans’ closing lineup (Ball/Redick/Ingram/Williamson/Adams) ran a specific set a few times in order to get Ingram the ball in a position he likes. It looks like they start in a [box set](https://i.imgur.com/1cVZInN.jpg). Notice that **Ingram** is on the left low block and **Adams** is on the left elbow.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a [video](https://streamable.com/01zdc7) showing the 3 plays they ran out of this set.

&amp;nbsp;

To get into the box set, Lonzo brings the ball up, usually either down the middle or left side of the court. Adams goes to the left elbow, sets a back screen for Ingram who cuts to the left block. Then, Adams sets a down screen for Ingram, who comes off the screen ready to catch the ball on the left wing facing the basket (the videos show the action a lot better than my description). 

This action usually flows into an Ingram/Adams pick-and-roll on the left wing, or just an Ingram isolation. The unsung part of the play that really makes it work (in my opinion) is the way that the two other players, JJ Redick and Zion, are used. They usually don’t do much besides maybe screening for each other (to get Zion an easy dive to the rim or Redick a 3), but the threat of a Redick catch-and-shoot 3 or a Zion lob causes defenders to be more wary of them and prevents them from sending too much defensive attention to Ingram.

It seems like the best way to guard this is by using Lonzo’s man to dig down while Ingram has the ball and this could possibly blow up the pick and roll with Adams.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my summary of the three examples of the play in action during yesterday’s crunch time possessions:

&amp;nbsp;

[Possession 1](https://streamable.com/7r1jgz)

[Possession 2](https://streamable.com/vnv5lw)

[Possession 3](https://streamable.com/3madve)

&amp;nbsp;

In the first possession, the play flows into an Ingram/Adams PnR and Sabonis (Adams’ man) drops back to cover the Adams roll, Brogdon is caught up a little on the screen and neither man can credibly contest Ingram’s pull up jumper in the paint. Both McDermott and Sampson keep a careful watch on their own assignments and are unable to help much. Notably, McConnell (Lonzo’s man) is mostly out of the play. Result: **Ingram 2 pt basket on open paint jumper.**

&amp;nbsp;

In the second possession, the play again flows into the PnR action, and Brogdon is again slowed down by Adams’ excellent (totally not moving) screen. Adams’ man, this time Myles Turner, hedges to prevent the Ingram open 3, Ingram reads the play excellently and hits Adams on a dive to the rim. Notice that Justin Holiday (Lonzo’s man) digs down but since Turner is out of position Holiday and Sabonis can’t get there to help in time. Result: **Steven Adams dunk off pass from Ingram**

&amp;nbsp;

The third possession is an example of the play getting blown up. Lonzo’s man (Oladipo this time) digs down again as Ingram has the ball, but Adams decides not to set the screen (not exactly sure why) to give Ingram an isolation look with Brogdon. However, Adams’ man (Turner) is in an excellent position to wall Ingram off from the basket and then Oladipo’s positioning comes in handy once Ingram tries to go the other way. Brogdon does a great job of containing Ingram with the help of his teammates here. Result: **Ingram misses contested midrange jumper**",[OC] Pelicans late game offense: Using a box set to strengthen the Ingram/Adams two man game
"This is one aspect of his game I have wanted to monitor, considering how mediocre he was from three point range at UGA (29% on 8 attempts per game).  

Early returns are.... well basically what you would expect.  Dude needs to dial it back a notch with this Westbrook-esque bricklaying .","Anthony ""A1"" Edwards 3pt shooting this season: 29% on 6 attempts per game"
"Title explains itself

 Mines include 

Both Damian lillard buzzer beaters against Houston and OKC

Curry vs Okc 2016 

Kawhi Leonard's 2019 against the 76ers 

Jordan's 1989 buzzer beater vs the cavs 

Kobe 2009 vs D wade and the miami heat 

Theres alot more to cover and I cannot list them all 

What is yours?

Edit: I forgot Drose against Cleveland 2015

Edit II: last second shots count also idc",What is the best buzzer beaters in your opinion?
So Lou averages 52% FG when he makes the first shot and just 32% when he misses the first shot which is just absolutely insane. Does this theory apply to other players as well?,Is the lou Williams first shot theory real for other players too?
"He's legitimately been playing like a top 20 player for about the last 3 seasons, was an allstar in 2018 and should have been in 2019 (over Sabonis imo) and is probably the only reason Orlando hasn't been in the lottery the past 3 years. Orlando won't be bad this year that they would trade him and the Jrue Holiday trade probably upped his value because he has more term and is a better player which another team probably wont wanna pay the price. Its crazy the shift he had from an above average center from 2012 to 2017 to maybe the 4th best (after Embiid, Jokic, Gobert , and KAT in no particular order).",Is Nikola Vucevic the most underrated player in the nba?

"I was beginning to work my night ""shift"" and I was set to watch Nets vs Jazz, but I decided to switch to Lakers vs Grizzlies because of the commentator and play by play. He used to be the lead commentator on NBA and NFL on our ESPN (I'm from Brazil), now he's on another channel, but still on a NBA task. I usually don't pick a game just because of broadcasting in Portuguese, but whenever he is on the booth, I pick that game.

Do you have a favorite broadcast crew that you follow, no matter the game? Or vice versa, a crew that you hate so much that you skip every possible game with them on the booth, or just downright mute the broadcast?",Have you ever watched a game just because of the broadcast crew?

"He’s been out even during the pre season with “knee soreness” but to be out that long with that injury title is kinda weird. 

Batum has stepped up in his absence getting starter minutes but I assume he heads to the bench once Morris comes back (no way they payed him 16M to come off the bench) which could ruin his rhythm

Ben Simmons has barely improved on offense in any meaningful way 4 years in the league, but his defense has improved to a perennial all-defense and fringe DPOY caliber player. Unlikely he improves much on his offense going forward after little improvement in 4 years.

"In the NBA draft we see a lot of raw, unpolished talent selected high in the draft because they have the potential to get better at the game when they get some experience and NBA training instead of being expected to be a solid contributor from their first season and get better.

In my opinion, some examples of project players in recent drafts are guys like Aleksej Pokusevski, who are expected to become starting caliber players in some years. 

So, according to you, who is a ""project"" who panned out?

Just based off experience and knowing what they're capable of doing. They've seen it all in the last 6 years. They have nothing to fear whereas a team like the Clippers have everything to prove. I would not want to play them in the first or second round even if they were a low seed. They have less expectations and less pressure to win but they're gonna bring that same intensity like they do in the past even if they aren't as good. I would treat them the same as if they were still that 73-9 team.  I feel they would have the psychological advantage over most teams. Just the fear of what Curry can do is enough to make you doubt yourself.,Are the Warriors a low key threat if they make the playoffs as a low seed?

"I feel like there hasn't been a nationally televised game on TNT, ESPN or ABC since like Christmas. What's up with that? I don't get NBATV so I've only been able to watch my local team's games, which sucks, and I feel like if I drop $60 for NBATV streaming then all of a sudden all the games I want to watch will be on TNT or ESPN again.",Why no national games outside of NBATV?
"It is not an easy decision due to how much the game has changed and how much guards are expected to score and shoot now. 

Out of these who would you take over Stockton: Dame, Trae, Harden, Luka, Steph, Kyrie, Westbrook.

CP3 is close to stockton's playstile so he is a case of which player you prefer and not which playstyle you prefer.

What is your prefered playstyle for your PG? What traits would you look for in your PG for the modern NBA?","Who would you rather have for your team: Stockton a pass first traditional PG elite on both ends, or a modern day score first PG that might not be as good defensively?"
Thunder lost 2 all stars for Paul George. It seemed like a cradle robbery at the time but now looking back pg left soon and Dipo/Sabonis are all stars. Do the thunder do the same move now? George is the best player of the 3 but 2 all stars &gt; 1.,"If Thunder knew about Sabonis and Dipo development, would it still be a good move to get Paul George?"
"Title pretty much says it all. What moments in NBA history do you feel are under appreciated, whether it be a game, trade, signing, or a stretch of games.

For me it’s Jimmy Butler in the 2020 NBA finals. Particularly games 3 and 5. It was special for me because it wasn’t a product of supernova shooting like Lillard and Harden are one to produce, or spurred on by supreme athletic dominance like Giannis. Hell, even though Jimmy’s a smart player, he wasn’t even outsmarting the other team (ie. LeBron, Jokic, CP3). He was just willing his team to victory in a way I’ve never really seen. It’s cliche, but this is the ultimate example of wanting it most (not that LeBron and the Lakers didn’t want it). It was made all the more powerful by game 6 where it was clear he was a dead man walking. You can even see in the start of this season that he really gave every ounce of himself to win those games.

Also, for a one game example, my favorite underrated game is Kobe dropping 42 in the first half against the Wizards on March 28th, 2003. I was never and still am not exactly a Kobe fan, but it was in my opinion the best half of basketball I’ve ever seen.

Edit: in case it wasn’t clear, it can be recent too, “historical” is honestly just anything before this season.",What are your favorite moments in NBA history that are historically underrated?
"The Spurs still have the narrative of a plodding team, but they played the fastest pace during the bubble.  They are playing uptempo again this year despite playing the majority of their games against some of the slowest in the league (Nola, Utah, LAL twice).

What don't people realize about your team?  I'd like to know the things that the stats, the national broadcaster, or the r/nba frontpage don't tell me.",What specifics of your team are others getting wrong so far this year?
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pokusal01.html. 
  
I know it's harsh to pick on rookies but I'm just hoping to see some answers that can encourage me that this guy won't be a total bust. His body doesn't exactly look NBA ready and the current shooting of 2/21 from the field and 1/16 from three with many misses barely touching the rim is far from promising. I think Jamal Murray started his career 0/16 so that's the best answer to the question I can think of but are there anymore?",[Serious] What are the worst starts to an NBA career in a players first 5 games? Currently Aleksej Pokusevski has recorded 10 turnovers and 5 points on 9/6/- shooting splits in 80 minutes.
Do you y'all think it's fair to compare Zach Lavine to Prime Carter? Same player build and archetype.,Zach Lavine comparable to Vince Carter?
"As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%).

McCollum has made 28-65 of his shots beyond the arc while Nurkic has been 6-14 from the line. 

https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers","As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%)."
"That's all.

You want more? Terrence Davis is on the outs with the Raptors anyway right? Or better yet, Kyle Lowry could keep them in the playoffs. Meanwhile the Raptors could stand to get rid of one of those two. Not like they're competing this year anyway.","Orlando Magic should trade for Kyle Lowry or Terrence Davis, and Raptors should blow it up."
"I'm just watching the Hawks struggling to score 10 points in a quarter right now and they are actually pathetic. No flow offensively and giving up offensive rebounds for fun. The team has lost to the Cavs, Knicks and should lose comfortably to the Hornets. Just like last season, they are the ultimate pretenders after 3-4 games and will struggle to win 25 games again.  

As for Bogdanovic, the less said about him the better. The Bucks absolutely dodged a bullet. I will give him time to adjust but the guy looks nowhere near a 20m/year player",The Hawks are nowhere near a playoff team and Bogdanovic might be the most overrated free agent signing of the off-season.

Whenever I see threads on this subreddut or even articles from ESPN about the best Eastern team at a shot to win the chip it feels like the pacers are almost never mentioned. The starting 5 seems so balanced and with how Sabonis and Oladipo are playing it seems like they could potentially have 2 all star players.  I feel like the team doesn't have a glaring weakness that some of the other contending east teams do.,Are the Pacers the most underrated team in the east?

"Anybody know the rules surrounding the play in tournament and the lottery?

If you make it to the play in as a 9th or 10th seed, win, then reach the playoffs, are you out of the lottery selection? Do you stay at your previous standings position but are just not included in the drawing? Or do you stay locked into both no matter what happens?

If you place 7th or 8th, lose, and get knocked out of the playoffs, are you then included in the lottery selection? Do you keep your previous standing or go down to 9 or 10?

"George hill, imo, is the most obvious and likely player who will be traded at the trade deadline this season.
The thunder are clearly in rebuild mode and are in asset accumulation mode and we know how much Presti loves his draft picks.

Hill should be of interest to most contenders because of what he brings to the table as a player, locker room vet, and his contract is great.

Hill’s contract: This season George Hill will make a fully guaranteed  9.5 million dollars which is a good price. However next season Hill is making 10 million dollars with only 1 million guaranteed so if a team doesn’t like his performance, they can waive him without taking a big cap hit. 

Hill as a player: George Hill is known for being an elite shooter and a solid defender. Last season with the Bucks he led the league in 3pt shooting as he shot 46% from deep. This season, he is shooting 43% from 3 which is still great. 
Hill isn’t the best playmaker but he isn’t bad by any means as he’s averaged over 3 assists in the past couple of season while playing under 25 min a game.


I think Hill could help the Nets now that Dinwiddie is out. 
If the Clippers want to move on from Lou Williams, then Hill would be a great replacement.
The Celtics could also use George Hill.

Ultimately, these teams would probably have to add draft capital to entice OKC.

"At this point I think it should be accepted that second round pick Nikola Jokic is both the best passing center we’ve ever seen, as well as one of the greatest offensive centerpieces in the game today. His skill set is mesmerizing, blending skill size and intelligence which has already been shown to elevate in the playoffs. Early on in the season, this dude is averaging 22 points, 11 rebounds, and almost 13 assists. Stats on this level are unsustainable, and the season is young, but does he have a legit shot at being the third player ever to average a triple double over the course of a season? 

The first direction in answering this has to be looking at Westbrook’s run from 2017 until the end of his Thunder tenure. Denver’s performance as a team will likely be one of the biggest factors in wether or not Jokic can accomplish this feat. The limitations of the post Durant-Thunder roster called for Westbrook’s direct involvement every trip down the floor. Not only was he allowed to dominate the ball... they needed him to. Denver’s roster is much better, and they have a legitimate co-star for Jokic who will have the ball in his hands a lot throughout the season, but we’ve already seen the Nuggets heavily lean on their superstar center to start the year. Additionally, if we can be honest with ourselves, Westbrook’s personality surely played a role in this statistical feat, and I don’t think Jokic will care about his stats enough to hunt them out as the season goes down the stretch. With that said, Jokics passing is always in such a flow within the offense, it may not be such a challenge for him.

Look, do I think it will happen, probably not. But I swear I have never seen someone like this guy play basketball. He’s fucking different, and I think an MVP season could be in the cards regardless. Jokic certainly has a chance to make some history in his career, and honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a part of it.",Jokic on triple double watch for the season?

"It feels like cp3 can do anything on a basketball court, from running the PNR, having a money midrange game, deadeye passer, high assist to turnover ratio, and very vocal as well.

Let's say the offensive team tries to dunk the ball but blows it massively. The ball touches nobody on either side and reaches the backcourt. Can the offensive team grab that ball because it hit the rim?,Is it a backcourt violation if the ball hits the rim but nobody touches it until it reaches the back court?

"The Knicks are currently the 11th best defense by defensive rating, but teams are shooting an unsustainably low 29.5% from three against them. There are a lot of smart people who believe that defenses can't affect how 3 point shooters shoot, there are also a lot of smart people who believe that smart teams know which threes to give up, or contest better. The Celtics, i think, had a low defensive 3pt% for years. 

Nevertheless, here's how teams would look assuming teams shot league average 3pt percentage against them. The formula is taking (Defensive 3pt% - Average 3 pt%)\*(Defensive 3pt attempt rate)\*(100) to get the D rating adjustment. All the data is taken from basketball reference.

I'm firmly a Harden hater don't worry about it I just want to understand what the argument is about.

EDITEDIT: So Harden has a higher eFG for many seasons but I'm not sure that was what was being referenced. And my understanding is the weighting changes the figures so it's era dependant(when you account free throws into the equation), but I'm not very knowledgable so...

EDITEDITEDIT: Another I found as I'm learning to use the stat sites is per 100 possessions Harden's highest is 2019 season 48 to Jordan's 46. And TS% .672 to Jordan's .614.

Unlike MVP/Finals MVP, it actually takes into account the whole season. So I feel it is more grounded in reality when it comes to judging who the best player in the world is. Unfortunately it only dates to 1993, so certain Michael Jordan seasons, Kareem's entire career, and many others all time greats missed out on the opportunity to receive one.

"With the competitive instinct he had as a player he has squandered the Hornets ever since he owned them. Been comfortable sitting around 7th or 8th or just outside the playoffs. The Hornets contracts have been crazy. Overpaying guys like Batum and low balling Kemba. Their coaches are always poor or jmediocre. Whenever they sign ""big names"" it's usually guys way past their prime like Tony Parker or Dwight. Kemba was the only all star they've drafted in last ten years since Jordan has owned the team.

I know Jordan was bitching a few years back when it was Warriors vs Cavs every year in the finals for awhile that the NBA made it to hard on small market teams because of all these other teams scooping up all the big names to create superteams. Maybe it's a lack of money causing him to fail the Hornets? Seems like he should be trying harder than he has because of his ""do anything to win"" mentality from the past.",Why do you think Jordan hasn't been competitive as an owner like he was as a player?
"I know it’s really early in the season but my top 3 surprises are Keldon Johnson, Sabonis, and Christian Wood (Tobi as an honorable mention). I expected all 3 to be good, just not like this. As for disappointments, Oubre (I believe he’ll figure it out), Devonte Graham (Same as Oubre but to a lesser extent) and Mitch Robinson (massive foul trouble/scoring has been an issue this year, still looks great on D). Let me know who you think!",Who has been your biggest surprise and disappointment so far in the season?
As the title says. Not talking about centers defending the post. Who is in your top 5 for 1 on 1 perimeter defense and who is in your top 5 for help defense?,Who are the top 5 1 on 1 perimeter defenders in the league and who are the top 5 help defenders in the league?
"Where do you rank Curry as an ISO scorer, I think he’s just under Harden, KD and maybe Kyrie but where do you rank him? Is he Top 5-10 or even lower?",Curry as a ISO scorer
I know the Raptors suck right now but you can not say he is overpaid. Dude straight up balled out today and was the only reason this was not a 30+ blowout,"Fred Vanvleet today 35 points,7 rebounds,3 assists and 2 steals and shot 65% from the field and 66% from three"

The Raptors went on to lose against Boston in the second round including games where they got blown out by 18 and 22.

"It is nice to see that the 76ers aren't blowing leads once Embiid and/or Simmons sit. Maxey has proven to be a smart team player so far this season, and has been a nice backup PG off the bench. With his help tonight, the 76ers improved to a league-best 6-1 with their win over the Hornets.

"In the 3:20 period when Booker sat, the Suns were a whopping -19. Now, for context, the Suns were already down during the moments when Booker sat and most of his +/- is derived from clawing back a 31-point deficit into a close game. But still, this is a mind-blowing little bit of single game +/-. Booker’s usual backups, Langston Galloway and Jevon Carter, were -19 in the 3 minutes they shared the floor.","Against the Clippers last night, Devin Booker was +14 in 44:40 of play time ... the Suns lost by 5."

"Full Quote:

&gt;I felt Montrezl Harrell had a really interesting response to the uptick in his face-up game this season, and how the Lakers' offensive system differs to teams he has played on in the past. Harrell currently is shooting 55% on his midrange attempts, and a career high in frequency.

Trez:

&gt;""Honestly it's just being able to play my game, not being totally set on it's gotta be this, this or this, and it's kinda been the system I have kinda been playing in for awhile. It's gotta be threes layups or free throws. It's not like that over here. They play to their style of everybody's game, and we're not looking at anyone like you got to do this, you got to do that man, we play basketball over here""

&gt;It's a free-flowing game, nobody tries to go outside of themself, and I think that's what the best thing is about being over here on this team and being with these guys because everybody does what they already do well, nobody try to go out there and prove they do something that people haven't seen""

"Curry finished the game with 5 rebounds and 4 assists as well.

It was refreshing to see Steph back in form. His energy is unlike anyone else's in the league that we've ever seen.

"At the time of the trade everyone clowned the Sixers for giving up Fultz and only getting Jonathan Simmons and a “fake first rounder” in return. Flash forward to 2021 and that fake first has turned into Tyrese Maxey. Maxes not only a promising prospect but he has been giving the Sixers meaningful minutes already. His stats have not been overly impressive but he’s looked great as a primary ball handler with the bench unit, can create his own offense and is an active defender. Meanwhile Fultz has become even more inefficient than he was in Philly. He’s also making $20m a year for 4 years while Maxey only makes 3/4.

Young is averaging 28.2 ppg and 10.7 of those are coming from free throws that he intentionally draws. Steve Nash criticized it saying it was not how you play basketball.

"Basically, just going off plain potential, who’s better?

Ayton was the first pick and is often overshadowed by his peers Luka and Trae. But he is no joke at all. He’s already a walking 20 and 10 when he’s not on diuretics. 

Bam has a lot of potential with his shot, if he can extend an already solid shot to the 3-pt line. 

But same can be said for Ayton about his shot. His form mechanics already work.

Ayton will probably never be the passer Bam is, but his post game  can be more valuable in given time.

And defensively, I see a lot of upside to both of them. Bam is more versatile because of his perimeter defense, but I could see Ayton effectively playing the Embiid or Gobert role on defense and anchoring the paint protection if he continues to grow on defense, which he already has.

Scoring wise, I think he already may be better than Bam at scoring, but that’s just me. I do still think it’s a given in the future though.

With that being said, who you got?",Better talent: Bam Adebayo or Deandre Ayton?

One of the most amusing things about watching San Antonio Spurs games to me is watching their coach Gregg Popovich on the sidelines. Somehow, he has not lost his competitive fire at all at age 71 and he remains as spirited as ever toward the refs and his own players. Whenever the cameras cut to him “going Serbian” (in his own words) I’m always curious about what gets him so ticked off. Usually, this is extremely difficult to decipher in the moment. When I watched him fly off the handle late in the 1/5/2021 game between the Spurs and the LA Clippers, I decided to look back at a few plays down the stretch of that game and try to get to the bottom of what had him so angry.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 1

https://streamable.com/mqkme3

In this first clip, Keldon Johnson (no. 3) messes up a switch and doesn’t get to his man (Luke Kennard, no. 5) in time, leading to an open jumper. Although the play does end up in a Clippers turnover after Kennard misses the shot, Pop strikes me more of a process than a results guy and I’m sure defensive execution is something he drills on a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 2

https://streamable.com/rtquxz

The next frustrating breakdown I saw was with about 2:40 left in the 4th, when Lou Williams (no. 23) blows by Johnson for a layup easily with his speed advantage. Demar Derozan (no. 10) is there with the help, but he is a step late and Williams is such a great finisher that there’s not much Derozan can do. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 3

https://streamable.com/npkwyp

The very next play, Johnson and Patty Mills (no. 8) mess up a defensive coverage on the pick and roll and this leads to an open 3 point basket. When Lou Williams sets a ball screen for Kawhi Leonard (no. 2, Johnson’s man), Patty Mills begins guarding Leonard since he thinks the two are supposed to switch the players they are guarding. However, Johnson fights over the screen and stays with Leonard also, leading to Williams popping to the top of the key and nailing the shot. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 4

https://streamable.com/9363l1

The next defensive possession for the Spurs, Patrick Beverley uses a drag screen from Kawhi Leonard to drive the ball to the hoop and pick up a layup. In this play, Johnson stays with the ball handler (Beverley), but floats a little bit too far to the right, giving Beverley an easy lane to the rim. Johnson’s positioning is probably fine in terms of depth, since at this point in the game Beverley had canned SIX 3-pointers and the Spurs might not have wanted Beverley to raise up and shoot the ball as he came off of the screen. However, Johnson should have been able to slow Beverley down enough for help to come. Thus, you notice that he does not drop back to explicitly take away the layup in favor of offering a 3-pointer, but goes up to the level of the screen to run Beverley off of the 3-point line. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Pop reaches the end of his rope

https://streamable.com/5x4h14

I slowed down the clip to try to read Pop’s lips as the camera catches him speaking to the players here. I think he’s saying “HEY! Can you guard somebody?” directed at either Gay, Derozan, or Mills, since Johnson is on the other side of the court.

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/svkuo0


With 5.7 seconds left, Patty Mills had two free throws to ice the game but the Clippers insisted on a replay review instants before Mills was about to shoot his first free throw in an attempt to “ice” him. Basically, the strategy is to make Mills think about the free throw more and psychologically influence him to miss it, a strategy which has been debunked before. When the refs decide to stop and review, you can hear a voice (probably Pop) yelling in the background, “THAT’S BULLS--T”. To be quite honest, Pop is not wrong since I believe the rulebook states that replays must be executed before the foul shooter sets foot on the free throw line. 

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/536dkr


At this point, Pop’s rage knows no bounds and the cameras show his next victim to be Keldon Johnson. I’ve slowed down the clip below, and it appears Pop says, “Oh, is that what you’re saying? Huh? HUH?” possibly dismissing Johnson’s attempts to defend himself. 

&amp;nbsp;

"The Denver Nuggets HAD been the brightest team with the best looking future in the NBA. This season, they are obviously off to a bad start, going 3-5 after losing to the mavericks. I believe that the two main reasons for this are the departure of Jerami Grant, but the horrendous coaching from Michael Malone. 


Malone has beet trying and forcing a 4 guard lineup, ultra small ball. These lineups have not been working at all, only hurting the team. The opposing team almost always goes on long runs against these 4 guard lineups. Also, rebounding has been a massive problem all season. How do we fix this? By putting 4 guards out on the floor, according to Malone. 


Jerami Grant decided to move to Detroit, wanting to become a larger part of the offense. He was an excellent wing defender, along with Torrey Craig, another wing who left the Nuggets. The Nuggets have repeatedly been getting pounded from deep, and it seems like opposing teams go 50% from downtown due to the lack of good wing defense. The front office replaces these players by signing 2 undersized point guards, leaving the team with 5 point guards. That's 1/3 of the entire roster, point guards.


Because of this, I don't see the Nuggets presenting a challenge to any of the top 4 teams in the west, an utter waste of the superstar talent the team has in Jokic, Murray, and Michael Porter Jr. I see the Nuggets landing at 5th or 6th seed unless there is a significant turnaround.",The Denver Nuggets' disappointing start to the season.

"As most people know, the current league protocol is if a player has been in contact with someone who had it, they have to isolate for 7 days at minimum (even if they have had the virus before you can get reinfected but the evidence suggests it isn't very common).

"1. They get drafted to the LA Lakers one year apart as high lottery picks. 

2. They play together on a rebuilding Lakers team, do relatively well but not exactly as good as they were hyped up to be. 

3. Both gotten rid of in replaced with a new more popular player of their position and a somewhat similar play-stye (LeBron and Lonzo) 

4. Both find their way on to a thought to be bad New York team (Nets and Knicks) and out preform and drastically improve as players becoming the surprising new leader of the team. 

5. The team out preforms expectations and 
become the new exciting fun team to watch with a new culture (with the help of new coaches (Kenny and Thibs) 

Only difference is D-Lo gets traded and the Nets acquire starpower from D-Lo (possibly what’s next for Knicks?)",The careers of Julius Randle and D’angelo Russell are eerily similar...

While Jokic isn't the best regular season performer (although this season he may prove us wrong), he always step's his game up in the playoffs. In only his second year, he made it to the conference finals, only losing to the eventual champs. Will Jokic be as good as the players I've listed here? Not super likely. Is he showing potential to be one of the best playoff performers of this era? I think yes.",[OC] Jokic's playoff stats vs HOFer's first 2 years in the playoffs

"Famed point center Bismack Biyombo has started the last seven games due to a Cody Zeller injury, and averaged 3.0 assists per game, after recording zero coming off the bench on opening night. He has recorded 21 assists in these games.

Over this same stretch, Terry Rozier, who was once seen as a point guard for some reason, has recorded 20 assists, 2.9apg.

Felt this was a stat that needed to be known by more people. Do what you like with this information.

"Noticed this intro/outro while watching Spurs vs Lakers rn and it was really dope. I YouTubed it using said title and I found it! One of the coolest sports theme? And is there possibly a better/longer version?

"[Article](https://sports.yahoo.com/los-angeles-clippers-all-star-paul-george-mental-health-struggles-nba-190030411.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKYQKkV6MaMHNqVbFeSbfKHkG7z-dq_LKXTrBJKfoMFwYNUKZYm2sWa_5T7xcc3RPYRA8qfs83KIepQGR18V8JgpzsfTkfMRsFbv-7sO0r21keYMElO-2IXPWYTZcjsFEzU0BlfgEZ-nl6Ykww0LmuXn2xP4opuRrsrNS-tfd0uG)

There has to be a question of Paul George's new reputation as 'soft' is due to his openness about mental health, which this article brings up.

Paul George doesn't know where it's coming from: 
&gt; Last year was last year. I'm in a new situation; I am in a different mindset. Any of that hate stuff, you got to ask them. I don't know where that's coming from. 

Ben Rohrbach in the article directly blames this new hate on Paul George's openness about mental health.
&gt; Was George “soft” when he rebuilt himself into an MVP candidate after suffering one of the most brutal leg injuries the game has ever seen in 2014? No. Was he “soft” for taking umbrage when Cameron Payne wildly jumped on that same leg after the whistle was already blown, sparking Booker’s outburst on Sunday? No.

&gt; We all know why Booker said what he said. Except, George is not “soft” for having the courage to share publicly what others in the NBA would not. He is stronger. Mental health struggles are real, especially during the pandemic, and professional athletes are not immune. Paul himself called this his top priority as the National Basketball Players Association president over the summer. His lines on the court might be blurrier.&gt;","[Rohrbach] Paul George is back on top because he shared his mental health struggles, not in spite of them"
"So this is more about fit then anything. You want to build a team that can try to win this season. I’m gonna give you some options, use them to create a 8 man rotation(or just a starting 5 if you’re lazy). Just follow the directions and you’ll get your team.

If you did all of those you should have a total of 8 players. How is the team you just made. Who are your starters and bench guys? Is your team capable of winning a finals in today’s nba?",Follow the guideline to create the best team you can. Why did you pick who you did and how do they fit together?
I know Josh Hart plays warzone. He talks about it quite often on Twitter. Also didn’t bron play football in hs? Just interested to hear this tbh.,Best gamer/multi sports athletes in the NBA?
"I haven't.

One of the minor talking points in the bubble was that players now have a lot more space under the basket and don't have to worry about falling into clunky cameras and tweaking an ankle. I thought I would have noticed the absence of those specific camera angles, but I nearly forgot about them. The main angles they would provide are the baseline angles (used sparingly) and for halftime/post game interviews .

I think we should do away with that angle permanently and have the cameraman needed for interviews sit elsewhere.","Between the bubble and the start of this season, have you noticed the lack of baseline cameramen in terms of the camera angle they provide?"

"Having watching him play at Bentonville, then Kentucky, I feel like he is. I want him to be successful, but damn. 
I have not watched him play in the NBA but I hear he is doing poorly. What do you think?",Is Malik Monk considered a bust?
"about*

It seems like there has been a lot less ref complaining so far this season than usual. In seasons past, I swear every post game thread was complaining about the officiating. This season, and maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like I see a lot less of it.","Have the refs gotten better, or are we all just complaining out them less?"
"He also had a block and 3 steals, one of which basically iced the game. He was 7/15 from the floor and 3/7 from 3, with all of this threes coming in the fourth quarter. He did this all without De'Aaron Fox. The dude just plays way beyond his years, and is looking well in the race for ROTY.","Tyrese Haliburton drops 17/7/6 in his first game back from injury, including 15 in the fourth quarter"

|^[boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com](https://boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com/) ^by ^/u/bazman1976 ^(original work by /u/Obi-Wan_Ginobili)|",[Post Game Thread] The Boston Celtics (6-3) defeat the Miami Heat (3-4) 107-105 off the Payton Pritchard putback game winner
"He started the game 0-6 from the field, then went absolutely nuclear. He had two and-ones and a crucial block on Bradley Beal (who was incredible, scoring 60 points) down the stretch.

Embiid's performance was just enough to eke out a 141-136 win, keep the home winning streak alive and propel the Sixers to an NBA-best 7-1.

edit: 38 points, not 37 (that's 63% of a Bradley Beal!)","Joel Embiid: 37 pts on 11-20 FG, 3-4 3PT, 13-13 FT. Also added 8 reb, 5 ast, 3 stl, 3 blk"
"Timberwolves fans told everybody that Jimmy Butler and Thibs were the problem.    

Last year Jimmy proved them wrong by being the guy to lead his team to the finals.    

Now Thibs is proving he is still a great coach.        

Meanwhile the Timberwolves still suck.      

IDK maybe the problem is KAT?",How bad does it look that both Jimmy Butler and Thibs are succeeding after being run out of Minnesota?
"I was bored and decided to look up what he was up to now with the Pistons, and as it turns out he's giving them a solid 15/4 in 20 minutes a night. Pretty good for someone who spent the majority of last season in the G-League with his career looking like it was gonna go by the wayside. 

Is this just another product of good numbers on a bad team, or is Josh Jackson = future all star back on the menu?",Is Josh Jackson's resurgence for real?
"It seems like literally all of the coaches hate doing it and they usually give non-answers anyway, so what’s the point of doing the interviews at all?",What are your opinions on the mid-game coach interviews?
Austin Rivers has hit some clutch shots in the previous 2 games including a dominating performance in the 4th quarter tonight. 3 years/10 million seems like a steal so far.,Austin Rivers in the Knicks win tonight vs the Jazz: 23 pts/3 rebs/2 asts on 9/14 FG (5/7 3pt) including 14 consecutive points for the Knicks late in the 4th
"Here are some guys who I think deserve a little more love, even if none of them are necessarily not liked

George Hill: An extremely steady, calm, two way point guard. I love how he literally never plays outside his comfort zone, seems like a good leader, and appreciate the work he's put into his three point jumper. 

Lowry: When people talk about the ""desire to win"", I think Lowry embodies that as much as one can. Dude is literally always finding some way to impact the game if he has the ball or doesn't. Defensively he's obviously a master charge taker, and sturdy post defender. Offensively you can trust he'll end up doing something valuable with the ball. Whether it's getting to the line, hitting a three, or finding a teammate. He does have the tendency to flop, but overall, such a joy 

Redick/Korver: Just absolute professionals who have put a ridiculous amount of work towards perfecting one skill: Shooting the ball. A shit ton of repetition and practice to become near all star level players despite lacking impressive physical tools. 

Josh Hart: My favorite player by far, the reason being that his entire game is literally effort based. Hart has genuinely below average talent. He's not a skilled ball handler, not super athletic, and doesn't have a good shooting stroke, or high court vision. The only reason at all he's a serviceable player is because he tries really freaking hard on the defensive end, bodying up bigger guys and securing rebounds like few others guards in NBA history. Even then he sometimes gets lost on defense. He basically is an example of how far 100 % effort in NBA games can get you",Under-appreciated players!
Not including the injured players obviously. But there are a few names that come to my mind immediately. What do you think?,What player do you think has regressed the most this season from last? So far anyway

He looked the best he has since the shutdown although Toronto took another L in their schedule. However if Siakam can get his shit together the Raptors might be able to follow suit.

"Since 2011, 40% of first overall picks were named Anthony (including Karl-Anthony). It is quite amazing how one name can be connected to such a coveted draft position. While we are yet to see how all of their careers will turn out, it seems there are some definite perks to having the moniker. In the grand scheme of things it's astounding to think that around 5.5% of all number one picks have been bestowed the same first name. This thought came to me out of the blue, but let me know if y'all have any theories......",Does Being Named Anthony Increase the Chance You're the 1st Overall Pick?

"There are supposedly talks of NBA expansion and Seattle - if you believe the rumors - is at the top of the list of cities capable/deserving of a team. 

If the NBA was to expand it would likely add 2 teams rather than just the one. 

What other city would be the best fit for a new franchise and why?  

Vegas seems like the obvious answer for a number of reasons. Or do they go international and look at returning to Vancouver or opening shop in Mexico City? Perhaps the Cincinnati/Louisville/Lexington? Reward the heartland with another team in either St. Louis or KC? California seemingly has enough teams and they were indifferent toward the Chargers, but San Diego is the largest city in America without an NBA team.",Along with Seattle - what other city would be the best for an NBA expansion team?

4. Jazz
5. Pelicans
6. Warriors
7. Kings
8. Blazers

Here was my predictions for the standings before the start of the season (bracket number is where how far that are in reality vs where I predicted them as of January 6th 2020):

**My predictions:**  
East:

1. Nets ( -7)
2. Bucks ( - 4)
3. Celtics ( - 1)
4. Heat ( -7)
5. 76ers ( +3)
6. Raptors ( -7)
7. Wizards ( - 5)
8. Pacers ( +5)

West:

1. Lakers ( -1)
2. Nuggets ( -10)
3. Mavs ( -6)
4. Clippers ( +1)
5. Jazz ( +1)
6. Warriors ( 0)
7. Rockets ( -6)
8. Suns (+7)
9. Blazers - toss up between 8/9 (+1)

1/10th of the season through, most of these picks look horrible.

I made these predictions an hour before the first game of the season. Let me know if you're curious for some of my picks or what your own picks were. For instance, for the Rockets I made the assumption that James Harden wouldn't play for the Rockets again and would be traded for some decent pieces (I was wrong).",How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?
"I suspect I'm over-thinking this, but I dislike the term 'small ball' because playing small is not the point. It's caught on because it rhymes and is relatively easy for people to picture: More small players, fewer big players.  But it's not about being small for smallness's sake, because if a team could play five big, fast, skilled, switchable guys who were all 7 feet tall, then that's what teams would do. A line-up of five Kevin Durants would be amazing. 

The point of what's commonly called 'small ball' can vary, but it's usually some variation or combination of the following:

* speed ball - fast, up-tempo play
* skill (or versatile) ball - multiple ball handlers, playmakers, shooters who can present many offensive looks
* switchable ball - similar to the previous item, but more of a defensive focus on guys who can switch without compromising match-ups

If you could rebrand 'small ball' then what would you call it instead?",What's a more accurate term for 'small ball'?
"The NBA credited Lamelo Ball with a 3 pointer with 2:12 seconds left in the 3rd quarter that was actually hit by Devonte' Graham. Here is the quote from the box score and here's a picture curtesy of a redditor below: [https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9](https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9)

"" **2:12 LaMelo Ball makes 24-foot three point jumper (P.J. Washington assists) 77-64 ""**

This shot can clearly be seen just after the 7:00 mark of the video highlights from the game (posted literally by the NBA): [https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422](https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422)

Devonte' Graham made the shot - NOT Lamelo Ball.

Is the NBA trying to inflate the stats of Lamelo Ball? Or did Vegas do this somehow as the over/under for Graham was set at 11.5 and this shot would have made the over hit?

TL;DR: Graham scored 14 points this game but was only credited with 11 after this 3 was given to Ball instead of him.",Devonte' Graham had his 3 pointer incorrectly credited to Lamelo Ball

"I think the Lakers are in a tier of their own, and the Clippers are in a tier of their own below the Lakers. 

It's impossible to predict if Harden decides to buy in with Houston or if a trade will go through. And I don't have faith in NOLA if Zion doesn't start playing defense and if SVG doesn't figure out how to maximize his players instead of running Ingram hero ball down the stretch.

So other than LA, I think these are the six teams likely to make the Western playoffs. All of them except the Suns have proven they can make the playoffs with their current core and coach. And CP3 has better teammates on the Suns than he did on the Thunder, so with their hot start showing things are working it's hard to think they'll miss the postseason. 

So how do you rank these six Western teams? I'd say Nuggets, Jazz, Suns, Mavericks, Warriors, Blazers.","Rank the following Western playoff teams: Suns, Jazz, Nuggets, Blazers, Mavericks, Warriors."
There shouldn't be a question at all that he is an All-Star this year. Dude has been absolutely on fire and is by far the floor general for the Pacers.,"Malcolm Brogdon career high with 35 points, on 13/25 FG, 4/6 3PT, and 7 assists."

Just a crazy piece of trivia made more funny but their similar name structures. These 2 always found their way onto contenders. Go Sixers and Warriors to keep the streak!",There has been a D. Green in every finals matchup since 2013.
What game has been the best game this year? I feel like there hasn't really been a game that stands out from the rest. The best game I can think of was bucks vs celtics but that might just be because I'm a Celtics fan. Wizards vs nets was good too,Best game of the year so far

Nash, Rose and Giannis are the only MVP's to not reach the Finals. I know it is very early for Giannis and he will most likely play in many. I just thought it was interesting that there weren't more MVP's to not play in the Finals. This dates back to 1955.","Derrick Rose, Steve Nash and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the only MVP winners in the history of the NBA to have never played in the NBA Finals"
"$72 million and his minutes have been trending downward with each game. He doesn't even start. Kevin Huerter played 33 minutes off the bench as well.

"Hey y'all, pretty hectic day in the US yesterday so it may have been pretty easy to miss what went on in the Association last night, rest assured I have got you covered. Lots lots lots went on in the NBA last night and I really tried to get you guys the scoop here, let's get into it.(Note this is generally tailored for NBA Fantasy players, but still something all NBA fans would enjoy)

&amp;#x200B;

Nightly Notables

&amp;#x200B;

* Markelle Fultz goes down with a torn ACL
   * Extremely devastating new for Fultz and the Magic. Fultz was averaging career highs in nearly all of his stats and this crucially hurts his development as a player. 
   * I can not stress this enough, but if Cole Anthony is available, add him ASAP. He filled in for Fultz and played a career high 32 minutes. Anthony is a very talented rookie and it will be interesting to see how he fares as the lead point guard for his squad

&amp;#x200B;

* Bradley Beal Drops Career High 60 in the L to Embiid's 38
   * Wow were the stars shining in this one, fitting that the game with no defense yesterday featured a team from Washington playing in it. Beal exploded for 57 points in three quarters, but only scored three more the rest of the game as the 76ers took over late and were able to contain him a bit. Beal's final line was 60 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists
   * Embiid on the other side of the court scored 38 points on 11/20 shooting and 13/13 from the stripe to go along with 8 boards and 5 assists. Embiid's Sixers are off to a sizzling hot NBA best 7-1 start and I think it is only fair for the MVP Embiid talks to start brewing up a bit. 
   * Also want to note that Simmons and Westbrook were their usual triple double threat side-kicks with a 17/6/12 line for Simmons and 20/8/12 line for Westbrook. They continue to prove their worth as daily top options at the PG spot.

&amp;#x200B;

* Hayward, Grant, Brogdon, and White all decide to drop career highs too
   * Gordon Hayward looked awesome against the Hawks pouring in 44 points and hitting some tough shots all game long. It is great to really see Hayward fully healthy and really looking aggressive and confident. It will be interesting to see if he can build upon this explosion
   * Jerami Grant has been terrific early on for the Pistons and although they took the L to Giannis and the Bucks, Grant still dropped 31 points and grabbed 10 boards to go along. Grant has really rewarded those who drafted him in their leagues and seems to have the green light to shoot whatever he wants for Detroit. 
   * Malcom Brogdon dropped 35 points on the Rockets on 13/25 from the field and 4/6 from beyond the arc. Brogdon has been playing at a high level this whole season and Warren's injury has elevated his game even further as he is averaging 26.5 PPG since Warren went down. Brogdon is turning into an elite option at PG for fantasy owners and is really stepping up his game this season
   * Coby White looked incredible in the loss vs the Kings, putting up a new career high with 36 points in 39 minutes. White is starting to find some more consistency as the season progresses with his third straight 20+ game, but he probably won't be playing nearly 40 minutes a game when Sato returns to the lineup

&amp;#x200B;

* Most Improved Randle?
   * Julius Randles has been to simply put it incredible to start the new season. He continued his great play with a 30 points, 16 board, 7 assist outing in a come back win vs the Jazz to lead the Knicks to a 5-3 record this early season. Randle has become a nightly triple threat type of player and after being skeptical at first, it really is looking like Randle might actually be a star player in this league 
   * Also want to point out, Thibs is back to being Thibs, nearly all of his starters played 30+ minutes and Randle, Payton, and Robinson all were either close to or over 40 minutes.  Also important to note Rivers has seen back to back 30+ minute games and is solidifying a role in his rotation, while Quickley saw just 5 minutes. Rivers played great last night in the clutch and had 23 points off the bench for NYK. I would not give up on Quickley entirely as the prior game Thibs trusted him down the stretch. Definitely a situation to monitor. I am curious what happens when Burks returns

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Wall Shines again as Harden struggles with his shot 
   * John Wall impresses again with an efficient 28 points on 12/20 shooting to go along with 6 rebounds and 3 assists in 37 minutes. Wall is back to looking like his healthy, speedy, dynamic self that we saw what feels like ages ago in Washington. He is really looking like a legit top option at the point guard position
   * Harden on the other hand ""only"" scored 15 points on 5/14 shooting and 1/5 from three, although he was in his playmaking mode with 12 assists. His past two games he's gone 10/31 from the field and 4/16 from three. Would not be too concerned about Harden obviously as we all know how talented he is, but I think there could be some reason to believe his points might dip from what we are used to due to the talent on this team with Wall+Woods+Cousins. Again would not be worried much with Harden though as he is one of the best scorers of all time and he has had immensive amount of success with talent around him before, but just some quick knee-jerk reaction here and maybe even could be a time to try and buy him low.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Raptors continue to struggle while the Suns continue to impress 
   * Devin Booker lead the Suns in a balanced attack over with 24 points, Deandre Ayton grabbed a double double with 11 and 16, and CP3 dished out 8 assists as the Suns improve to 6-2 on the early season. The addition of Paul has really helped this team continue what they started in Orlando 
   * The Raptors on the other hand took another L and now fall to 1-6 on the season, and especially with the season being shortened 10 games, they need to figure this out soon. Siakam had his best game of the season dropping 32 points to go with 9 rebounds, but still was not enough to take down Phoenix  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Hitters

* Davis Bertans came off the bench but played 32 minutes and ended up starting the 2nd half instead of Avdija who only saw 15 minutes of action. Bertans has seen back to back games of 30+ minutes and is seeming like he is back to startable territory due to his 3pt presence
* Seth Curry caught fire with 28 points shooting 11/14 from the field and 6/7 from three, which included a 5/5 first quarter from beyond the arc
* Early DPOY front-runner in my eyes, Myles Turner was at it again, this time swatting 8 shots against the Rockets 
* Tatum and Brown combine for 48 in Celtics dub over Heat
* Jimmy Butler plays his best game of the season dropping in 26 points in the loss to the C's 
* Zion and BI combine for 53 in the loss to OKC
* Steven Adams records his first career triple double with a 10/11/10 line
* Coby was not the only Bull doing work, LaVine put up 32 points and Carter grabbed a double-double with 11 points and 17 boards
* DeAaron Fox left the game with hamstring tightness and did not return for the 2nd half, his injury will be one to monitor for sure, I personally do not believe it is too serious as he was celebrating the win with his team on the bench and was moving around. 
* Bagley put up his best game of his season with 21 points and 12 boards, while running mate Richaun Holmes added 24 points on 10/11 shooting as well
* PG and Kawhi match each other with 21 a piece in the Clippers win over the Warriors as Steph struggles with his shot only scoring 13 points

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Report

&amp;#x200B;

* Tyrese Haliburton 
   * Haliburton came back after missing his past two games and after not doing much in the game, turned up in the 4th quarter scoring 15 of 17 points, which included some clutch 3s, and finished the game with 7 boards, 6 assists, and 3 steals. Fox went down in the first half with hamstring tightness, which I do not believe to be too serious, but still he missed the remainder of the game and if is forced to miss time, Haliburton is for sure startable in my eyes and a great DFS play
* Lamelo Ball
   * Ball continues to really show out scoring 16 points on 6/12 shooting and snagging 8 boards to go along with 5 assists. The BC Vytautas product has started to come into his own and is looking like a real threat in this league. He only saw 23 minutes of action tonight, but more minutes are bound to be coming this way if he keeps this play up
* Issac Okoro
   * Okoro returned back to the starting lineup after missing the past 5 games for the Cavs and saw 28 minutes if action. He scored 10 points on 4/5 shooting, while he is not the most attractive fantasy player currently, he should be monitored in 9cat leagues due to his efficiency and has a do-it-all type game 
* Saddiq Bey
   * Bey poured in 20 points and grabbed 10 boards for his first career double double in 24 minutes.  Bey has had a solid start to his career in Detroit and is a player that is worth adding, due to him starting and playing around 30 minutes when the Pistons opt to rest Blake 
* Payton Prtichard
   * Pritchard continues to produce early on and especially without Teague in the lineup. Pritchard saw just 20 minutes last night though with Smart returning to the lineup, but scored 6 points including the game winning tip and grabbed 6 boards and had 4 dishes. He struggled with his shot going 3/10 from the field and 0/4 from three, but I would not be too concerned about that for now as his prior game he shot 8/13 from the field and 2/4 from three. Pritchard's season long value is not as promising though because eventually Kemba will be back for this team and Teague will still be there starting too for now 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am Excited to see tonight

* The Balkan Battle
   * Jokic and the Nuggets are taking on Luka and the Mavs in what is sure to be a fun game from the two European studs, won't be suprised if both players end with triple doubles
* Kyrie and the KD-less Nets get to take on Embiid and the sizzling 76ers
   * Two of the top Eastern Conference squads take on each other tonight, but how will the Nets fare with no KD, will they be able to repeat what they did vs Utah

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the Night: Bradley Beal(60 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 20/35 from the field, 38 minutes)

Dud of the Night: Trae Young(7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 2/9 from the field, 35 minutes)

Rook of the Night: Tyrese Haliburton(17 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 7/15 from the field, 34 minutes)

Player to Target: Cole Anthony 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope y'all enjoyed the run-down, see you tomorrow

"i was watching the game last night and noticed something interesting.. they had Dennis/Wes/Kuzma/Bron/AD out there.. going to run a high pnr with Bron/AD as they normally do at the end of games, so seeing the lineup my guess was okay.. it's going to be 5 out, spread pnr 

then i saw AD point to Dennis to stand in the dunker spot.. which was interesting.. https://i.imgur.com/U3Y5GW2.png

AD then sets the screen for LeBron, and as LeBron gets inside the three point line, Dennis runs to the three https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png

AD dunking the ball while Dennis is at the three https://i.imgur.com/YHr8m0k.png

reasons for doing this 

typically, a smaller player would be on Dennis, so when they come to help AD can just finish over them 

secondly, https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png looking at this picture, Brandon Clarke is the help guy now who was guarding Dennis, so Tyus has to be the in between guy focusing on Dennis running to the three and Wes in the corner, that's a pretty routine pass for AD if he chooses to do that 

just something i found interesting, don't typically see a 5 out pnr ran like this",Lakers run a LeBron/AD pnr with a wrinkle

"By this I mean, ignoring those two teams, they could feasibly beat every other team in the league in a 7 game series. Lowest total win % wins!",What are the worst 2 teams by record you could combine to make a championship team?
"The goal here is to try to make the best 15 man expansion team off non-protected players.

Rules:

1) Assume its the 2021 offseason and we're having an expansion draft

2) Post 8 players/rights from your favorite team that you would like to protect as a parent comment. To make it more interesting, this includes restricted/bird/non-bird salary rights. For example, the Hawks can use a keeper on John Collins' restricted rights this offseason instead of an 8th actual player considering Collins is going to be an FA and not under contract with the Hawks this offseason.

3) I'll reply in the comment thread on who I'm plucking your team (only 1 player per team.) I can choose a player's restricted rights instead if you do not choose to protect them. 

4) Obviously since there are more teams than roster spots, I can choose to pass on picking from your team",League Expansion Game
"Ben Simmons and Draymond Green are two of my favorite players to watch and I think both have similar, but unique skillsets that I thought would be fun to compare, and I’m curious which player would be more valuable to your favorite team? 

Ben obviously is not close to Draymond in terms of legacy right now. Dray has proven to be a ‘16 game player’ and a champion. Ben has been co-leader of a winning team each year of his career  but hasn’t got past the 2nd round in the 2 playoff runs he played.

That being said In terms of skills I think they’re both great in transition. Ben is faster but I think a little more turnover prone than Dray. They both focus on finding shooters and Draymond clearly knows how to get Steph and Klay open. (For example look at the last shot Steph got for 62!)

In the half court they have different roles. Draymond is a more willing shooter and roller and Ben is a better at driving off the dribble and a bit better at better at passing imo.

And on defense they’re both great but in different ways. Draymond will anchor and coach a defense as well as anyone in the league and he’s so smart at reading pick and rolls and knowing players offensive habits so he can stifle them.

Ben on the other hand will defend the hell out of your best scorer and could very well be the best  1v1 defender in the league, while leading the league in steals last year, but he won’t be a rim protector. 

Who would you add to your team right now? I’d imagine the choice will differ depending on the team.",Simmons and Draymond side by side

"Reading about Beasley in the G league draft made me think about how much of a journeyman he's been and then thinking about Tyreke who always comes up when it's about ""falling from almost a star"" or similar (eligible for reinstatement later this year) - they both have had at least 10 years in the league and relatively productive, so curious who is thought of as more disappointing.",More disappointing: Michael Beasley or Tyreke Evans?

How likely is this? What would you expect from an interview/conversation between them? What would you want them to talk about specifically? I'd be interested to hear them discuss anything about basketball and their careers.,Many years from now do you think there will ever be a 1-on-1 interview between Michael Jordan and Lebron James?
Money wise I know it would be a plus but I mean in terms of viewership. We would have 2 more teams which will probably suck for the first few years and it would add to the already abundance of not so good teams. A lot of the teams in the nba aren’t that good and adding more would just spread out the talent more and worsen the situation.,Would an expansion team be better Orr worse for the NBA?
"The phrase “Extremely underrated” seems to be used a lot at the moment, with the majority of it being used to describe certain Pacer players. 


35 points, 7 assists and a W vs Houston


21 points, 11 assists and a W vs Pelicans


33 points, 7 assists and a L vs Knicks 



But wow. What a display. Just watching him too, is very satisfying. A true PG. Did it all last season as well, this is nothing new. Pacer basketball is actually really enjoyable to watch. Really good chemistry with plenty of players who could all take over a game in their own ways. A team that has a lot of All-Star caliber players. I like what I see!

"As a Knicks fan, I am used to my team being projected to lose. They have not been the Vegas favorite to win in a single game this season. I pulled up the over/unders for the season to compare Vegas predictions to actual game outcomes and the Knicks have been the most underrated team of this young season. This figure shows the difference between actual and Vegas-predicted victories (teams that have beaten their odds plot higher on the y-axis):

[Actual vs predicted wins for 2020-2021 season](https://imgur.com/6nfIeWo)

I was curious how these trends stacked up against the last several years, so I pulled in data from the 2014-2019 seasons for comparison. The solid lines show a 1:1 trend (i.e., if Vegas predictions were perfect) and the dotted lines show the actual trends for each season. Lower slopes for the actual trendlines indicate that Vegas' predictions favored the high-win teams too frequently.

[Actual vs predicted wins from 2014-2019](https://imgur.com/rkQlbL4)

On average, Vegas predicts teams that finish &gt;0.500 will win 9% more frequently than they do, while &lt;0.500 teams are picked to lose 23% more frequently than they do. While the Vegas models do a very good job of predicting winners in general, you shouldn't get discouraged if they tell you that your favorite team will lose.",Vegas Predictions: An Underdog Story [OC]
"The most impressive thing about the Knicks on their hot start is that this team is dead last in 3PA and 27th in 3P. They are winning with barely any 3s at all. If you put some shooters in this squad, they might actually make the play-ins and compete for the playoffs.",The most impressive thing about the Knicks on their hot start
"After starting chubby and slow during the pre-season, it seems like Nicolas Batum is now in his best shape in recent years.

Context: 
&gt;Appearing on the All Things Covered podcast last Wednesday, Shaq was hardly covert when insulting Gobert who signed a $205 million contract extension with the Utah Jazz, saying “I’m not gonna hate, but this should be an inspiration to all the little kids out there. You average 11 points in the NBA, you can get $200 million,”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The former Los Angeles Lakers center also mocked Gobert, a player for the Utah Jazz, posting a photoshopped photo of him dunking on Gobert with the caption: “I would had 45 pts 16 rebound ten missed free throws in three quarters. He woulda had 11 pts four rebounds and fouled out in 3 quarters. I’m a G ”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Rudy responded on IG with: “I guess we’ll never know” and then continued on Twitter: “There is no beef. If people wanna keep speaking negatively about me or keep discrediting what I do it’s on them and all that does is show who they are. I will always be happy for a brother beating the odds. And I’m gonna keep beating the odds.”

&amp;nbsp;

I know some of y'all will say it's childish but I love this, NBA really needs more beef, everyone is too friendly. Baguette Biyombo is great, also ""oui oui Ostertag"" and ""hon hon hon Hibbert"" in the comments lmfao","Shaq continues taking shots at Rudy Gobert , retweets someone calling Gobert ""Baguette Biyombo"" after Jarrett Allen blocked Gobert at the rim"

"I was browsing on IG and i saw a post of Lamelo ball passing the ball to his teammate at the end of the shot clock , it had like tens and thousands of likes and the amount of people in the comments saying “he slick for that” or whatever is too damn high.",Idk who needs to hear this but a shot clock violation TO counts towards the team TO not the players.
"Looking at the Wolves vs Blazers game right now, Blazers up 77-59, and Dame has scored team high 26pts with good efficiency.

Yet when I look at his +/-, he is +0, and everyone else on his team are +'ve.

How does that stat even work? I'm completely stumped!",How does +/- work?
"It’s wayyy too soon to make any declarative statements here, but this draft class has a number of players that have impressed already. 

Oh before I go further, if you just want to hear the question and respond:

tl;dr, How normal is this for young players in their first 10 games? Has this draft already exceeded expectations? How have the rookies this year looked in comparison to previous years? Better or worse?


Wiseman and Edwards have both impressed, lamelo has been promising (although he has some cold streaks), Devin Vassell has been a rookie that pop believes in enough to play, Pat Williams has been impressive in Chicago, and, of course, Haliburton has been incredible. 

I don’t think this proves necessarily that everyone was sleeping on the draft class saying “no one is worth trading up for.” I’m really not sure how many rookies over perform in their first few games. I am a stupid man so I can’t remember what the normal amount of impressive rookies is. However, there’s a lot of guys to be excited about. Hope we see more promise as we get further(think when Killian Hayes, obi toppin, and Isaac okoro have shown flashes as well, okoro is looking like a guy who could play for a long time). Also think both quickley and tyrese maxey have all the makings of a guys who could develop into solid contributors  for any team  long term. 

Bonus: too soon guess at all rookie first team!

Haliburton 

Edwards

Vassell

Williams 

Wiseman 



Second team:

Killian Hayes*

Tyrese maxey

Lamelo 

Isaac okoro 

Isaiah stewart*



*note: just think when these rookies on the pistons(along with Sadiq bey) start clicking and get into the nba groove, you could see much improvement. I know precious and okongwu both are probably higher.","8 games in, 2020 draft class has looked promising!"
"It would probably be a cheap trade too. Most likely a second round pick and  another 2nd round pick swap (where NY gets the better of the 2)for Dennis and it’s a low risk high reward thing. If he hits then you have his bird rights and can re-sign him next year. If it misses then it was only 2nd rounder that was gone. 

Knicks have 4 point guards on the team (Payton, IQ, Frank, DSJ) and 2 others who can play spot minutes at the point (Rivers, Burks) so there’s not much loss for them their. 

I know the magic have two other PG’s in Bone and Mane but they’re on two way contracts 

Thoughts?",To improve their PG Depth the Orlando Magic should consider trading for Dennis Smith Jr

&gt;Ibaka wanted to stay with the Raptors and even coming off a career-year, the veteran understood that it might mean having to settle for a one-year deal as the club was doing everything in their power to avoid taking on commitments that would interfere with their cap space in 2021.

&gt;But the Raptors’ first offer – about $12 million for the 2020-21 season – was below what he was expecting and while Toronto came up to $14 million, they were still trying to keep some powder dry to pursue Gasol. That didn’t go over well with Ibaka who, according to multiple sources, resented having to play behind the Spanish international and wasn’t going to sign on for a shared role again. Ibaka quickly pivoted to the Los Angeles Clippers and their two-year deal for $19 million.

&gt;In retrospect, the Raptors absolutely could have kept Ibaka without being a tax team or otherwise altering their off-season plans now or in the future.

Reading this little tidbit from the article, it looks like the Raptors gave Serge a lower offer than he had expected at first, a one year $12 million dollar deal. Then they brought it up to $14 million, but also wanted to keep their options open to retain Marc Gasol as well. Apparently, this was a reason Ibaka decided to go to LA because he didn't want to share a role with Gasol. Serge now gets what he wants, starting for the Clippers. The Raptors end up losing both.

What are your thoughts? Did Serge seem unhappy about his minutes last season?","[Grange] Raptors offered Ibaka 12m/1y, then upped it to 14m/1y but Serge didn't want to share role with Gasol"

"Dude has been a godsend as a coach. He's been managing to get guys who suck bootyhole at defense play good defense. DSJ was playing great defense before injury, Kevin Knox went from playing garbage defense to around average, Bullock went from average to above average. 

On top of that his rotations have been solid. He's put in the right guys at the right moments to secure the win. Also with his rotation, the Knicks have had 6-7 guys injured for almost all their games, and he's able to have the team play hard with only an 7-8 man rotation on these nights.

"Couple years ago, many would say players are playing at their best when they’re 27-28 years old. Fast forward to today, we still have plenty of players performing extremely well in their 30s


Just a small sample, there are plenty more: 
Hayward (30 years old): Just dropped a new career high. Currently averaging the same numbers, at a higher efficiency that he put up during his all star season. 

Paul George (30 years old): Currently having second best season in terms of points per game, career high in assists.

LBJ (36 years old): Pretty self explanatory 

James Harden (31 years old): 29.4 ppg, second best season in terms of assists per game.

"Ever since I've been an NBA fan, the West was a conference that had absolute powerhouse teams. I've always found the 2007-2008 season very interesting for the very reason. I don't want this to come off as an insult to the East teams now, cause I think now the East is in a very interesting spot w/ loads of young talent doing well for their teams &amp; who have a lot of good seasons in the future. The west was fully loaded &amp; if you wanted to make the playoffs that year in the west, you HAD to play your heart out every single game.

The Southwest division had 4, FOUR, 50+ win teams. No division in the East had more than 2, &amp; only 3 East teams had more than 50 wins.

No West team secured a playoff spot until April 4, 2008.

The Rockets &amp; Suns had the same record, 55-27, though Rockets were placed a seed higher. The Rockets were 5th seed &amp; Suns were 6th.

Utah had the 4 seed despite Phoenix &amp; Houston having a better record, b/c Utah won their division. This meant 3 games seperated the 6th seed &amp; the 1st seed.

If the playoffs were just an 8 team tournament featuring the highest Win%, Boston, 66-16, &amp; Detroit, 59-23, would have the top 2. The other 6 spots would all be West teams.

The 38-44 Sacramento Kings, had they played in the East, would've made the 8th seed. On top of that, Golden State missed the playoffs by 2 games. If they were in the East, they'd have the 4 seed.

At the time, Golden State had the highest win% for a non-playoff team since the 8 team playoff format. This was tied by the 2013-2014 Phoenix Suns.

Every Playoff team in the West had at least 50 wins.

Finally, despite all of this, Boston beat Los Angeles for the NBA Championship.

Is there any other season that showed how lop-sided talent &amp; competition was than 07-08?",Has any season shown more of a talent &amp; competition gap than the 2007-2008 season?

"After watching Wizards let Embiid score 10 straight when the game was tied with 3 mins left, I was dumbfounded to see lineup:

ish Russ Beal Bertans and Bryant.

Clearly it is BBQ Chicken for Embiid. I was not surprised that Sixers dominated the rest of the game w 4/5 players half the size of Embiid and Simmons.

I get why Brooks left the team on the floor. It's the lineup that led the comeback. But that's the thing. They needed offensive fire power for any come back.

But with 3 mins left, 10 possessions left at most, you gotta play defensive players. It's a more conservative strategy to try to prevent the offense scoring in last 10. Take it possession by possession.

Embiid is the best center in the league. But the Wizards made it easy for him to score. They should have put in Lopez for Bertans and potentially do offense and defense rotations.","In a close game in the 4th, less than 5 points either way, it's more important to make stops with limited possessions left"

"New Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith joins The Woj Pod to discuss transforming his fandom into buying franchise, arriving along with Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert extension talks, leveraging NBA platform for social equality and charity and translating success of his tech empire into Jazz culture.

You can listen to, or download, their conversation on this link: https://traffic.megaphone.fm/ESP6909522314.mp3","Utah Jazz's owner, Ryan Smith, was a guest on ""The Woj Pod"""
"If Doc sends Austin a message tonight saying ""good game son"" is that legally tampering? If he tweets it will he get fined? What if he said something like ""wow good shooting wish some of my guys in Philly had that kinda hot hand!"" Is that stepping over the line? Seriously guys just looking for answers thanks",Tampering question
"Allen was definitely the best center in tonight's game, even though he was matched up against 2x DPOY and $200mil contract star center Rudy Gobert. He was spectacular both offensively and defensively, holding the Jazz to only 21/50 (41%) shooting from inside the 3pt arc, adding 3 steals and 2 blocks, all while only having 1 personal foul. The Jazz didn't lead once for the entire game and the Nets easily blew them out by 34, even without KD.
  
On the other side, Gobert had 10 points and 11 rebounds on 3/10 shooting. Tough nights happen, but it was very impressive how Allen was able to outperform a star center on both ends of the floor. He has a bright future.  
  
EDIT: Allen also had a mean poster right over Rudy, and both of his blocks came against Gobert himself at the rim.","Jarrett Allen matched up against 2x DPOY Rudy Gobert: 19 points, 18 rebounds on 8/9 shooting"
"From Seth Partnow's [recent Athletic Article](https://theathletic.com/2298827/2021/01/05/stephen-curry-points-warriors-joel-embiid-ben-simmons-collin-sexton-cavs/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=curry):

&gt;Prior to Sunday’s career-high 62-point explosion, “What’s wrong with Steph?” seemed like a much more live topic. He seems to quite dispositively have answered the question on his own in the two games since.
&gt;
&gt;That said, it might still be worth a reminder that even for the best players, bad streaks happen. A “bad streak” for Curry saw him open the season with a True Shooting Percentage of “only” 58.3 — still well above league average — on a gargantuan 32.2 usage rate. However, he had made only 18-of-56 3-pointers. Everybody panic!
&gt;
&gt;Except, such a string of rough shooting is … entirely normal. Throughout his career, Curry has had stretches of five consecutive games during which his total 3-point accuracy was 32.1 percent (his mark through five games this season) 48 times, or roughly once every 13 games. In other words, once a month.
&gt;
&gt;It just so happens that because his latest string came in the first five games of a season in which the Warriors’ find themselves bereft of talent — Kelly Oubre’s Golden State career could hardly have started worse, with two good performance lifting his season-long PER from 2.0 to a still unsightly 7.7 — after a long layoff, we were primed for a weekend of overreacting.

So, if you're worried about a player's shooting percentages this early, give them another month or so. It's early in the season.","[Partnow] Even for the best players, bad streaks happen...

Another impressive performance by Jokic despite going into foul trouble early and missing some easy shots. Nuggets improve to 3-4 and Jokic's MVP run has started.,Jokic drops 35/15/6 on 12/20 shooting with 1/1 from 3. Also adds 3 steals and a block.
"There is literally 3-4 guys that could go #1 who are all super prospects.

- Suggs
- Kuminga
- Cunningham 
- Green
- Mobley",Is this the most loaded draft class since 2003?
Wasn’t following basketball ball at the time. Hopefully you guys can provide some insight on this. Context was this question is whether or not Wade or Durant was the #3 behind Lebron and Kobe.,Was Kevin Durant a top 3 player in the NBA from ‘09-‘11?
"I'll preface this by saying I don't get to watch the Sixers much and so don't really know the ins and outs of their game, but I see the take a lot that Simmons and Embiid don't really fit together. We've seen oversized point guard and center duos be successful before like Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq. I know Simmons sucks at shooting, but if they were surrounded by shooters and strong defenders/role players I feel like it could work. Why is there such a lack of faith in their pairing long term?

Edit: I dont mean to imply at all that they are as good as those other duos. Just asking why stylistically it doesnt seem like many people think their games could work together when we've seen similar skill sets matched together before.","If Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq worked, Why Not Embiid and Simmons?"
"With averages of 24.1 Points, 11.7 Rebounds and 11.9 Assists, Jokic has established himself as a prime MVP candidate despite the Nuggets' lackluster 3-4 start. He leads the league in BPM (and VORP) and is second in PER at 31.1 (trailing only  at 31.6).

Despite all this, Jokic boasts a usage rate of only 26.8%, which is the 34th highest in the league. For comparison,  leads the league at 37.3%. This is even stranger when we consider the fact that a traditional big man like Drummond has a usage rate of 29.4%, which ranks 20th in the NBA.

This came as a big surprise to me, as Jokic seemingly affects everything on offense when he's on the court. 

Jokic also has a TS% of 70%, which is 9th in the league

Interesting side note: Jokic also has the the 6th best defensive BPM of 2.5, which is just below . This definitely over rates his defense but perhaps shows he's not a regular season liability on that end.

[Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html)","Despite leading the league in Assists, Assist % and BPM, and being second in PER, Nikola Jokic only has the 34th highest usage rate in the NBA (26.8%)"
"What players do you think would have benefitted the most from playing in a different era because of the style of the game (not the level of competition)? There are so many players of past generations whose talents could have been maximized in another era.

I always think of a guy like Steve Nash whose production skyrocketed after the hand-check rule was made. The current era would fit him perfectly as a floor-spacing, sharpshooting floor general. 

Conversely, I think Kyrie would have feasted in the early-mid 2000s as an ISO scorer with great playmaking abilities.

What do you think?","Who are the ultimate ""played in the wrong generation"" players?"
"People always talk about how Steph Curry is the greatest 3 point shooter of all time, but what about from the midrange and close to the basket? Percentage is part of it, but there is more to it, like who is guarding, when someone makes a shot, like game winners, and whatever else.
Some candidates I immediately thought of.

Midrange: Michael Jordan and Kawhi Leonard

Close: Shaq and Kareem

Those are just random guesses though. Who do you think is the goat at different ranges. Also feel free to discuss from 3 if you think it is not Steph, or who is goat from any other ranges.",Goat from different ranges
I’m wondering if the performance of some players is being affected by the absence of fans.     Are players who normally feed off the crowds energy (like Harden) playing worse? Are mentally weaker players (like Luwawu-Cabarrot) making more clutch shots because they’re not rattled by the crowd?,"Do you think some players are playing better/worse because there are no fans? If so, which players?"
"There was a debate floating around the internet today ranking SG’s in their prime between Tracy Mcgardy, Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade and James Harden. me personally i chose T-Mac, Wade, A.I. then Harden.",prime shooting guards

1. Pound for Pound= Size and Weight: In order to make these calculation we will be factoring in players weight and height
2. Era will be considered so all points will be adjusted to per 100 possessions
3. Primetime: Each players best SIX year stretch will be used for this experiment(**This is because legendary players stats tend to go down during the ends of their careers**).

***Size Score***= 1 point per inch in height &amp; 0.5 point per pound in weight

&amp;#x200B;

* Jarrett Allen monster double double in first start of season
   * Nash opted to start Allen over DJ and it worked out great for the Nets with Allen scoring 19 points and grabbing 18 boards over Gobert and the Jazz
   * It will interesting to see how Nash approaches the center position going forward, but this is great looks for Allen owners 

&amp;#x200B;

* Kyle Kuzma and THT are the ones benefiting from KCP injury
   * Interestingly the Lakers have been starting Kuzma in place of KCP's injury and he has seen 30 minutes in each of his last two games
   * Talen Horton-Tucker has seen 20+ in each of these past two games with no KCP as well
   * Both have not done much with these opportunities, but are both options that would not be horrible value plays on DFS if KCP is still out

&amp;#x200B;

* Juancho Explosion
   * Juancho Hernangomez unloaded on his former team with 25 points, shooting 10/14 and 5/8 from three 
   * There is just no way he can keep that play up, but it was fun to watch him catch fire against his old teammates
   * Another old teammate on Denver that got some extended run was Jarred Vanderbilt, the high-motor player saw 23 minutes of the bench and scored 11 points along with 5 boards. Vanderbilt is a great rebounder, so it will be interesting to see if he gets more time as the season continues, Naz Reid only saw 10 minutes as Minn opted to play a little bit smaller

&amp;#x200B;

* Paul George sits out, Kawhi shows out
   * PG was out, so we got a look on how this Clips team will operate without one of there main studs
   * Kawhi had a season high 30 points on shooting 13/22 from the field in 37 minutes, a big bounce back game from Phoenix where he shot 4/21. Leonard also racked up 10 assists which was also a season high, interestingly he is averaging 6.5 APG which would be a career high 
   * Kennard and Batum both topped 35 min with PG's absence as well. Batum scored 21 points which is his season high, but Kennard struggled from the field shooting 3/10

&amp;#x200B;

* Suite Life of Zach and Coby
   * LaVine and Coby combined for 39 points and 80 minutes in last night's comeback dub over the Blazers. Honestly, modest numbers in a sense that either one of these two could explode for 30,40+ on a given night, but these two are going to see a lot of action during this Western conference trip. Sato is out with Covid rules so Coby is seeing all the run at PG and if the Bulls want to stay in games, LaVine needs to be on the court. It will be interesting to see if the Bulls could ride the momentum they have started to brew on this trip out west. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Watch:

Anthony Edwards: Played 25 minutes against the Nuggets which has been pretty on par with is playtime throughout the season, he hoisted up 19 shots, but went 1/7 from three. His 28% from the three is not exactly what you want to see early, but that was his 7th game of his career and he seems like he has the confidence and ability to improve that. Regardless when he is on the floor he is the focal point, his 25.8 usage% is first for rookies playing over 10 min a game, but Melo Ball is very close behind at 25.5%

&amp;#x200B;

Facundo Campazzo: Lol is this guy really counting as a rookie, Facu has started to come into his own these past two games for Denver. He's seen 20+ minutes in each of those games and had double digit outing in each of those games. He only had two assists  in each of those games, but this man is a natural born playmaker, and if Malone keeps giving him minutes, those numbers are bound to rise

&amp;#x200B;

Desmond Bane: Saw 20+ minutes for the 6th time in 7 games although only scoring 7 points , encouragingly in his past 6 games he has shot at least 4 threes a game and is shooting 47% from three on the season. 

&amp;#x200B;

Devin Vassell: Only played 16 minutes last night, but the shooting was on display going 3/4 from three with 12 points. Vassell is playing behind some good talent in SA, but if he is shooting 54%(obviously cannot sustain this but impressive start) from three right now, more minutes should be eventually coming to him. He has also racked up 5 steals over his past three games. The 3&amp;D player he was advertised of at FSU is starting to show it in the league. 

&amp;#x200B;

Patrick Williams: Williams scored 14 points in 24 minutes in Chicago's come back dub. Williams is continuously showing flashes of his high potential. He really won't be the focal point of this offense at all this season, but he is a little bit of everything type of player and is shooting the ball well making him an attractive 9 cat piece.

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the night: Nikola Jokic(35 Pts, 15 Rebs, 6 Asts, 12/20 shooting)

Dud of the night: Demar DeRozan(6 Pts, 5 Rebs, 6 Asts, 3/9 shooting)

Rook of the Night: Devin Vassell(12 Pts, 2 Rebs, 1 Stl, 4/5 Shooting, 16 mins)

Player to target: Facundo Campazzo

An anonymous scout calls the Miami Heat’s 2020 playoff run a 'situational overachievement'

""They were not that good. Butler played out of his mind, Herro played out of his mind, they were all kumbaya, but they were not quite that good.""

(Via ESPN)

As a die hard Heat fan, it erks my brain to see the blatant disrespect we have been receiving from NBA twitter over the last couple of weeks. 

We pulled off an improbable finals run by beating the team with the best record in the NBA, most PPG in the league, as well as the the best DEF rating in the league. Notice how I said TEAM and could care less about the 2x B2B MVP they have as well. 

On top of that we beat a Celtics team that has gone to the ECF the last 3 out of 4 years with Jaylen, Tatum AND a brand new addition in Kemba Walker. 

I understand the “bubble” adds a certain X-factor to the equation that we can’t physically see in terms of data but when are people going to accept that our squad was and is actually great? 

I’ve never been more excited about the future of our team in terms of young talent with a core such as ours ESPECIALLY with the coaching talent we have to groom them. 

I’ve be on vacation from NBA Reddit for quite a bit so I’m not sure what the current consensus is on us, but let me tell you NBA Twitter is a bunch of casuals. It’s time I come back home lol.

The question I have for you all is, what makes everyone think we can’t do the same thing again?",[NBA CENTRAL] An anonymous scout calls the Miami Heat’s 2020 finals run a “situational overachievement”
"This doesn't have to be a massive bust or even a high profile guy, for me it'd probably be Frank Ntilikina. I was so sure that guy was gonna work.

"So in football there’s a kicker to take all your kicks, which are kinda of like free throws. Ofcourse no fouls lead to the kick, but nonetheless there are designated positions for that.

What if players like JJ redick or Jose Calderon could be signed for the sole purpose of making fts.

The points should still count for the player who took the beating in the first place because I know James Harden won’t be happy if 10 points get take away from his 34 ppg. 

The FT shooters themselves can be judged on FT’s made and FT’s attempted, no need for points. 

There is also the chance for increased foulbaiting because it’s more assured points, but to change that, what if these FT positions for every 4th foul your worst free throw shooter takes two. Therefore you’ll want to avoid, especially in the 4th quarte, the chance of your worst free throw shooter taking the game winning FT’s.

Dumb idea, but also pretty creative imo",What if teams could sign FT positions?
"Hi everyone, if this has been brought up before, this can be taken down. I was thinking a little bit this morning on what Adam Silver mentioned the other day about expansion and what would be needed to expand the league. But my question to you all is this...

Could a group of fans ( for Seattle or Las Vegas or some other city) create an investment group of fans like the Green Bay Packers have and make it work in the NBA? 

The idea would be the fans own the team, most likely a shareholders group run the team, but ultimately the team would be owned by the fans. Could this be done in today’s era, and what would be needed to make this happen besides money? 

While this might be a silly idea, I am curious to know honest and open ideas and how to make it work.",Fan owned team in the NBA?
"I think that the NBA has a lot of good choices for expansion and I'll put it in a list.

1.) Bring in Seattle and St. Louis/Kansas City

They should have never gotten rid of Seattle and no other teams are in Missouri.

2.) Bring Seattle and Vancouver and move Pelicans or Grizzlies to the east.

This is logical because Memphis and Louisiana are both in the east and west kind of and you could move either/or. Adding Vancouver could be a good way to bring the NBA more international.",IDK where to post this but I'll put this here and if it gets taken down so be it.
"There are many arguments on here like “KD is the most skilled player” or “Giannis is not skilled enough from a talent standpoint, his success is all predicated on athleticism.”

Has the word “skill” become synonymous with shooting? Think of the most skilled players in the NBA in your opinion. Almost all of them are good shooters, and for good reason as shooting is an important list.

Now ofcourse there are multiple more skilled players than Giannis, but to group him, Ben Simmons, and Westbrook into this “all athleticism minimal skill” seems wrong, no?

Like Giannis may not be the upper echelon of skilled *players*, but for *big men* he might just be.

Better passer than everyone except Jokic. Sabonis and Bam are arguable. Elite defensive IQ. His handles are probably the best in the game for a pf. Has numerous types of finishes, etc.

All of this applies to Ben Simmons too.

Is shooting too reflective of “skills” now?",Has “skilled” become synonymous with good shooter?
"He's looked pretty rough offensively these few games. He's currently averaging 8.5 ppg on 30% fg. He was real solid last year offensively too, He was putting up 16ppg on 40% from three on 5 attempts a game and had a 50% fg. Hoping he can turn it around soon, he's a super solid player.",What has happened to Norman Powell?

"The 2019-2020 Sixers were 31-4 at home (73 win pace) and 12-26 on away games (26 win pace). This made them one of the lost lopsided teams I’ve seen in a long time. At home, these guys were the 2016 Warriors, but during away games they always looked off, be it body language, shooting, etc. 

What contributed to such a wide disparity in play, and are there any other teams that were like this?","The 2019-2020 Sixers were on a 73 win pace at home, and a 26 win pace on away games. Has any other team had such a lopsided level of play depending on if their home/away?"

what happened to Kris Dunn, TJ leaf and Mo Bamba? where is Zhaire Smith and Dragan Bender now? what happened to the Dwayne Bacon, Moe Wagner and Frank Ntilikina hype trains?

so many players that I could name from the top of my head that had so much hype during draft day yet they are nowhere to be found now. did we forget about and them or they never had those hype to begin with?

Yet he's left-handed in writing. He's naturally born as a lefty but trained himself to be right handed. How come? Wouldn't he dominate even more if he was left handed? I mean look at the MLB. Some stars like Barry Bonds or CC Sabathia are natural righties but play left handed and have been stars that way.,Why is Lebron right handed in basketball?
"My father and I, both avid basketball fans, have an ongoing discussion about starting 5 in a playoff series. Just looking for opinions on who should’ve been chosen over our list.

Me
PG- Curry
SG- Kobe 
SF- Lebron 
PF- Rodman
C- Yao Ming
6- Karl Malone

Dad
PG- MJ
SG- Harden
SF- Bird
PF- Barkley
C- Shaq 
6- Nowitzki

Who would you choose and why? We’ll give our own reasoning on the matchups in the comments

P.S Drinking has been involved in this list so pls take that into account lol. Also we chose to discredit injuries and such. 

Edit- we couldn’t choose the same players, this is all about matchups, we also chose a 6th man over a substitute",Starting 5 in playoff series (All Time)
Title. I liked him as a player and he's a cool guy also. I even bought a red shirt inspired by when he was on GQ. But in Orlando and even more so now his stats look rough out there. I haven't seen many Raptors games after Kawhi and JV (I'm Lithuanian lol) left and that's why I'm asking :),What's up with Siakam?

"This is probably something that is probably best answered by “just start watching” but I want to shoot anyway. I am new to watching sports. I love playing them, but never really was a big spectator. I recently started watching NBA and I have really enjoyed learning about the individual teams. The problem is, the NBA is so BIG. It’s hard to follow all the trades, wins/losses, who is healthy etc. I want to follow a team (the closest one for me would be the Grizzlies), but I still want to understand the many different things that happen outside of one franchise. How do you do it?",How did you get into watching the NBA?
"Who are your new sleepers for the playoffs? Is a certain hyped up player really just a washed bum riding a high? Who is looking like a legit 6MOY? Should Christian Wood's nickname be ""The Cross""? Are the Raptors making the playoffs? Will Julius Randle's legs survive Thibs? Is Jokic your regular season MVP or Finals MVP? Will the All-Star celebrity game be played on 2K? Go off nephews.","A few games into the season, what are your new hot takes?"
"They had Gobert there thrice getting his ass handed to him but not the dagger from Zach. 

Even I didn't notice it until I read the comments from some angry Bulls fans. Has this been a common theme? 

You can watch the video here:  [Top 10 plays of the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkE1UufhFx4)",The NBA top 10 plays on their YouTube channel didn't feature Zach Lavine's dagger.

Any player surprised you being (or not being) on the list? Anyone surprisingly high or low? Which U-25 players have a chance to reach top50 in the future?

"It's a short sample size, but do you think Harrell was a good addition to the Lakers? I personally don't see how adding a huge defensive liability at the forward/center position can be considered a solid addition for a defense first team, even if he has scoring punch. 

The Lakers' defense in general just looks mediocre

What do you think?",Was Montrezl Harrell a good acquisition for the Lakers?
"Today I am going to discuss 25 players who are improving dramatically and whose stocks are rising.

**() Overall Rank**

**1 Jaylen Brown (25)**

I expected Brown to be solid but nobody expected this. Just 8 games into this season he has cracked my top 25 for the 1st time in his career while averaging over 26 PPG on over 57% shooting. Kendrick Perkins has been a huge supporter, going as far to say that he is better than Jayson Tatum. That's overboard but at this rate he is a shoe-in for his 1st all-star appearence.

**2 CJ McCollum (28)**

McCollum has always been considered one of the better 2nd options in the league, but he has taken his game to the next level so far. His solid play has already put him in serious consideration for his 1st all-star appearance with over 27 PPG on over 43% shooting from 3 while shooting a ridiculous near 12 3's a game. It is yet to be seen whether he can keep up this insane production throughout a whole season and I have my doubts but if he were to continue at this rate we could potentially be talking even all-NBA level.

**3 Tobias Harris (32)**

Harris has been one of the most efficient scorers in the league for one of the best teams in the NBA. Rivers has given major praise to Doc Rivers so far and the coaching change seems to have done wonders for his game. Shooting over 47% from 3 with a career-best 22.6 PER so far, Harris is inching closer to equaling the value of his max contract right now at least.

**4 Malcolm Brogdon (38)**

Brogdon is probably the most under-the-radar player on this sub right now. He has established himself as one of the best point guards in the East (I currently have him 4th) and has great efficiency while having a career-best year in terms of advanced defensive statistics. He's also shown a knack for clutch plays, hitting a game winner against New Orleans.

**5 Collin Sexton (41)**

Dwyane Wade gave praise to him yesterday, and Sexton is quickly establishing himself as a potential consistent all-star talent starting in 2022. He is able to give you 20 points in his sleep and is shooting over 55% from the field in 7 games while leading Cleveland to a winning record.

**6 John Wall (53)**

Modern medicine is amazing and Wall is proof of this. While not in elite status anymore, similar to Derrick Rose, Wall is proving that he provides value still.

**7 Joe Harris (70)**

Harris has fit in well with the now star studded Nets, shooting over 51% from the 3 so far and looks to be a key piece looking to contend.

**8 Myles Turner (71)**

Turner is low-key on pace to potentially have the best season of his career, shooting over 70% inside the 3 while averaging an insane 3.6 BPG so far. He's shooting more 3's and if his efficiency from there can improve, he could be a top 50 player by season's end.

**9 Julius Randle (76)**

I'm skeptical if the Knicks can keep up this level of success the whole year but Randle's career-best play so far cannot be denied. He's improved in all areas, even defense where he is a plus defensive player for the 1st time in his career. 

**10 Christian Wood (78)**

Wood is quickly moving up my overall list at this rate. He's drawn praise from James Harden and has quickly become a favorite on this sub due to his perseverance in overcoming adversity.

**11 DeJounte Murray (79)**

Murray's game is limited by lack of 3-point-shooting but he does everything else well for a point guard and has nice size. His scoring load has increased by about 30% from the previous season and has come up big in games such as 21 points in a win vs. the Clippers last night.

**12 Mike Conley (87)**

Conley's 1st season in Utah was a disappointment, but so far this season he is starting to change the narrative on him. With solid averages of 18.6 PPG, 5.0 APG, and 4.1 RPG, Conley is proving that he can still be effective as he enters his mid-30's.

**13 Jordan Clarkson (94)**

Clarkson has turned into one of the more underrated scorers off the bench in the league. He is currently averaging 15 PPG on career-best efficiency and has cracked my top 100. He just needs to stop pushing refs.

**14 Seth Curry (98)**

Seth has now cracked my top 100 for the 1st time ever. He is the x-factor behind Philly's success and is averaging over 15 PPG on over 54% shooting from 3 and Seth has not missed a free throw this year. 

**15 Terrence Ross (108)**

I don't think anybody expected Ross to average nearly 21 PPG so far. He has career-bests 41% from 3 and a 20.8 PER. If he continues playing at this pace, he will move into the top 100 quickly.

**16 RJ Barrett (116)**

Barrett has become a dangerous weapon and despite not being drafted to the greatest situation, he is inching closer to a top 100 spot in his 2nd year. However, he is one of the worst 3-point-shooters in the league currently and that needs to improve.

**17 Markelle Fultz (128)**

The eye test shows clear improvement and he has moved up on my list a tiny bit from last year, but his shooting efficiency has regressed. There's a lot to like still, the athleticism is incredible and his playmaking has improved. But the progression of his shooting will determine whether he will be a clear top 100 talent or a more athletic Elfrid Payton.

**18 Mikal Bridges (138)**

To go along with being a favorite of defensive analytics, Bridges is also shooting over 46% from 3 so far this year. Unquestionably, the addition of Chris Paul has helped Mikal continue to progress and at this rate he will be near the top 100 by the end of the year.

**19 Deandre Hunter (148)**

Hunter's reviews after his rookie year were really not good, but he's showing why he was picked 4th overall in his 2nd year. Hunter's offensive game has developed as he is currently shooting over 48% from 3 while averaging nearly 16 PPG. He still has a little bit to go before top 100 after a bad rookie year, but he's looking good.

**20 Avery Bradley (192)**

Bradley's role wasn't expected to be as big as it was but he's taking advantage, averaging 13 PPG on 59% shooting from the field and over 52% from 3. It's only been 5 games but Bradley is looking promising so far.",20 Players Progressing Rapidly
"His last video was on December 25th.
They've been using a number of other people to voice the high lights but they don't make rhymes or do the topten thing at the end.",What happened to the NBA Top Ten guy?
"Hey all, big time NBA fan here. 

I follow basketball on all of my social media platforms. I can’t get enough of it. The personalities of the players, the athleticism, showmanship, teamwork, the statistics, and especially the camaraderie between players on the courts which is really quite beautiful to see so many talented people being able to share their passion and talents with one another, much like when artists collaborate. On top of it all, the NBA in particular is lead gloriously by Commissioner Adam Silver, who has proven how deeply empathetic and intelligent he is since taking over the league. He is a stand up guy, a person who everyone can look up to in how he handles social issues and impossible tasks. Look how he handled The Bubble. Crazy. What I’m trying to get to is that Adam Silver seems to care about people. And he cares about the players. He’s embraced the idea of players around the league opening up about mental health issues, and seems to focus more on their well beings than business operations, which is very unlike many people ‘on top’. With all this being said, it would seem that the rest of the NBA community would share the same empathy for human beings. 

When I read articles and basketball news, I like to read the comments to see how others are thinking (why I still do this, I don’t know). I’m met with TOP comments full of unnecessary hate, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and blatant disrespect towards other commenters and especially the players. Some of these comments are obvious trolls, but others are sincere and I’m baffled how anyone can say some of these things about other human beings. The PG interview last night where he explained how he hasn’t felt this much hate from the community in his 10 years in the league is sad. 

The WNBA page is the worst. Every comments section is riddled with hurtful things about women having no place in basketball, how they should “get back in the kitchen”, and how they’re just plain “boring” to watch. This is their passion. Their life. They’ve dedicated themselves to this life of hard work and training and you’re grading them as “boring”.

I don’t care for the argument “ehh they have no place to whine, they’re millionaires”. A lot of these players are good people with good hearts. They help their communities and donate to charities. They have families. They have humility. They’re human beings. 

Imagine if you dedicated your entire life to your passion only to have strangers screaming in your face, cursing you out, and narrating your reputation on the internet about the flaws in your passion. Wouldn’t feel very good, would it? 

We can be better, basketball community. There’s a fine line between competitive spirit and being an arrogant ass.",The NBA community should not be this toxic.
"The teams in the bubble had the shortest offseason ever and the teams that didn't had the longest. Obviously the teams that made the bubble were better in the first place, but relative to where they were expected to be this season: are the teams that were in the bubble overperforming or underperforming? 

Knicks are way ahead of where I thought they would be and it looks like some of the guys really took the long offseason to work hard and came in in great shape. Haven't watched a lot of the rest of the league to get a feel if that's a wider trend though.",Was being in the bubble a handicap or advantage for teams coming into this season?

"*assume both of these young stars sustain good performances*

Domas is easily the better passer. He’s probably the 2,3,4 best passing big man in the league. Both of them are relatively shot on defense, but Domas blocked a Boogie poster!

Randle is probably the better shooter, as however much Domas improved, Randle has reached god tier on efficiency.

At Rim: 58% vs 77%

3-10 ft: 41% vs 30%

10-16 fr: 52% vs 0%

16-3pt: 53% vs 0%

Context: The Cavs signed 6-foot-9 power forward Dean Wade in July of 2019, and the 24-year-old is now in his second season with the squad. 

Dwyane took a shot at himself in his remark, noting how he had a rather forgettable stint with the Cavs. The former 13-time All-Star played just 46 games for Cleveland during the first half of the 2017-18 season. The Cavs eventually traded him to the Heat in exchange for a second-round pick. In his brief tenure as a Cavalier, Dwyane averaged 11.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists in 23.2 minutes per contest.

What do you think Duncan Robinson’s free agency value is so the 21’ FA class? And what player and contract does it compare to?,Duncan Robinson FA Value?
"Do you see that lineup as a bonafide contender if Phoenix had taken Luka?  

They would be in prime position to compete for the next decade easily.  

Booker/Luka are 2 bonafaide #1 options at their current age.  You can't say that about a lot of other teams in the league.

Current teams that have a duo of All NBA guys are

- Lakers 

- Nets

- Clippers",Luka/Booker/CP3 -- What Could've Been?
"Free throws are not taken during the regulation game time.  They accumulate throughout the game and then after regulation both teams take their free throws.  If the score difference at the end of the game is such that the losing team still can't win if they make all their free throws and the winner misses theirs, then the free throws are just skipped.  

This will have the following benefits on the game:

* Eliminate flopping because you won't get the stoppage and free throws immediately.  And your might not get them at all depending on the points you got from normal shots.  Points from normal shots become much more valuable.
* Eliminate intentional fouling at the end of the game.  It does nothing for you now.


This will fix a lot of the problems that the NBA has.",[Discussions] Ideas to eliminate flopping and reduce game stoppage
"What's crackin. *Proof\_Tadpole* is back with another ranking list. We went over point guards, so today we are going over the top 10 small forwards entering the 2020-2021 NBA season. Gonna keep this intro short and sweet.

Note: This is a personal opinionated ranking of the small forwards I think would have a good 2020-2021 season. This is not to be considered as fact. I would also like to mention that with how the game is being played (positionless basketball), what you might think is a small forward, might not be a small forward for me (I would also like to let y'all know that my shooting guard post flopped a lot because of my ranking, which I take the blame for. I would like to thank y'all for the criticism, as it helps me improve on how I see basketball. At the end of the day, we are all fans of the game, and all of your opinions help me to better understand this wonderful game So once again, thank you, and hopefully this list can be somewhat of a come back). So if we disagree, I would like to let y'all know that our definitions are different, and that is okay; we just have to agree to disagree. Also shoutout to Andy Hoops for the inspiration. With that being out of the way, let us begin.

1. Lebron James- This is a no brainer. Like I could just leave it at that, but y'all know I am not going to do that. Last year, The King averaged 25.3 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 34.8% from the field on 6.3 attempts per game (which was the most threes he shot per game in an entire season). He also grabbed 7.8 rebounds a game and lead the whole league in assists at 10.2 assists per game, and ended up placing second place in MVP voting (which he seemed to have a problem with, as he tweeted out ""Only 16 First Place votes"" with 3 laughing emojis. He also said in an interview that he was pissed off about the MVP voting). He then turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 27.6 points on 56.0% shooting from the field and 37.0% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. He played out of his mind in the finals, averaging 29.8 points on 59.1% from the field and 41.7% on 6.0 attempts per game, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game. These numbers and the well coached Lakers team overcame the Heat in 6 games to bring the Larry O'Brian back to Los Angeles, and he was awarded finals MVP for his performance (which was a no brainer), where he said that he finally wanted his ""damn respect"", which he earned based off the performance he had in the playoffs. This season, I expect the Lakers to repeat as NBA champions, and I expect Bron Bron to lead the way (although, I do not expect them to get that top seed like they did last year, as I expect them to cruise through the regular season, and turn it up an notch in the playoffs, where I expect Bron to do most of his damage). At the end of the day, Bron is the best small forward and best player in the league, no doubts about that pick.
2. Kevin Durant- The reason why this list is coming out a little late was because I wanted to see some games from KD. Although the Nets record might be looking a little suspect (besides the first couple of games, that defense is cracking), KD's play has been phenomenal. In 6 games, the mans is averaging 28.2 points on damn near 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% from the field and 45.5% from three on 5.5 attempts per game), 7.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists. Add to that he looks really good (like the achilles tear never happened. Like bro looks like he got new bunnies) and his effort on the defensive end is also there, so he is well on his way to making a full recovery. And even if you didn't want to take in these stats because of the sample size, lets travel back to the 2018-19 season, where the slim reaper averaged 26.0 points on 52.1% shooting and 35.3% shooting from three on 5.0 attempts per game, bringing down 6.4 rebounds, and dishing out 5.9 assists per game (which only earned him an All-NBA Second Team selection). He then turned it up to a whole other level in the playoffs, averaging 32.3 points on 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% shooting from the field, 43.8% from three on 6.7 attempts per game, and 90.3% from the line on 9.3 attempts from the charity stripe), grabbed 4.9 boards and had 4.5 assists a game, before the strained right calf he suffered in the Houston series. He was the game changer in the NBA Finals, as he returned for Game 5 when the warriors were down 3-1. He scored 11 points in the first quarter, however, while trying to post up Ibaka, he ended up suffering an achilles tendon injury (which honestly doesn't seem to bother him at all). I have high expectations for the Nets, as I expect them to compete in a rather stacked Eastern Conference, and I expect KD and Kyrie to lead the way for them to reach their potential.
3. Kawhi Leonard- Mr. Terminator finds himself at the number 3 spot for obvious reasons.  In the 2019-20 season, Kawhi averaged 27.1 points on 47.0% shooting from the field and 37.8% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.1 rebounds and dished out 4.9 assists per game. He also played great defense (but not to the level that the media and a lot of fans were hyping it up to be, as he had to spend more time and energy on the offensive side of the glass, as the mans was a very integral part of the Clippers offense). His performance on the court rightfully earned him a second team all-NBA selection and a second team all-defense selection. The only problem with Mr. Leonard was that of his load management issues, as people outside of the Clippers bubble thought that this action of his would eventually bite him the back, as they speculated that the team would not have any proper chemistry with each other with the limited amount of games and practices that Kawhi would have with the other players (add that with the fact that Paul George was coming off that shoulder surgery, so the team really could not gel well with one another). The Clippers did seem to have a hot hand around February, but that momentum was squashed when the pandemic hit. Fast forward to late August in the bubble, and wouldn't you have guessed it, the Clippers are struggling in the playoffs. They barely beat Luka and the Mavs in 6 games, got up 3-1 against the Nuggets, and then forgot how to play basketball, as they ended up blowing that 3-1 lead and the series. Now, we all know Paul George wet the bed, but half of the blame is to be put on Kawhi as well (especially with that game 7 shooting, like my god). The stats may show you one thing (as he had good playoff numbers), but the eye test shows you something completely different (like, this was the first time I felt Kawhi was just out of it). But regardless, the past is in the past, and with the additions of Ibaka and Luke Kennard, I still have this team in contention in the west. Now, it is very likely they are not getting past the Lakers, but if they end up seeing them in the playoffs, I expect that to be a good series. So overall, got some pretty solid expectations (I guess more grounded than last year) for Kawhi, and hopefully he can bounce back and forget the disaster that was the 2020 playoffs.
4. Jimmy Butler- Imagine if Rock Lee from Naruto or Asta from Black Clover were an NBA player; you got yourselves Jimmy Butler. He essentially had nothing from the start, but through hard work, dedication, and a killer mindset, was able to go from a 30th overall draft pick who was seen as a glue guy coming off the bench for his defensive skills (so somewhat like Marcus Smart, side note: not hating on Marcus Smart), to a max player and leader of the team that earned their spot in the NBA finals. Coming into the 2019-20 NBA season, Butler was viewed as a locker room cancer and a player that was ""uncoachable"", which lead to a lot of people questioning his decision to sign with the Heat (as he was viewed as a person who wanted to win, but he left the situation he had in Philadelphia, a team that was a couple bounces away from going to overtime with the Raptors, and possibly going to the NBA Finals). A lot of people outside Miami slept on the heat, saying that they would just be a fringe playoff team, and that the signing of Butler was just so that they could put seats in the American Airlines Arena. But straight off the rip, the Heat ad Butler surprised many. Although Butler's 19.9 points on 45.5% shooting and 24.4% shooting from three on 2.1 attempts per game does not look like that of a player belonging on a top 5 spot, the intangibles he brings to the game is what sets him apart from other superstars (and yes, he is a superstar). He had a career high 6.0 assists and 6.7 rebounds per game, to go along with 1.8 steals per game (which truly does not depict his defensive value, as he is such an amazing defensive player, and the leader of that strong Miami defense along with Bam Adebayo). Even after the stellar regular season, a lot of people were still sleeping on the Heat, saying that they would be a second round out at best. However, in the NBA playoffs, Miami and Butler turned up the heat (pun intended). Despite his playoff numbers not being that eye-popping (22.2 points on 48.8% shooting from the field and 34.9% shooting from three on 2.0 attempts per game, 6.5 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.0 steals a game), Butler always kept the Heat in check, and always set the tone for what was one helluva finals run. He went off in the NBA Finals, averaging 26.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game on 55.2% shooting from the field and 30.8% from three, pushing the Lakers to 6 games, despite loosing Goran Dragic and Bam for the majority of that series, and proved to everyone on the planet that he was a winning player, rightfully squashing all of his negative baggage that came with him. Although the Heat seem to be struggling to start off the season (which is expected as they are coming off the shortest off-season in NBA history), I expect them to figure themselves out by the middle of the season, and I expect them to be the same dark horse (because I am just gonna keep it a bean, the Heat are legit), and I expect Jimmy to lead this team, hopefully for another deep playoff run (I really hope this man can get a ring. I loved him on the 76ers, and I was sad that we didn't choose to resign him, but I am happy that he is in a better situation now. Hopefully he don't get that Rock Lee treatment, cuz they did him dirty in Naruto. But like no cap, he do be like Asta doe. Like everyone hated on him, now everyone understands his struggles and appreciates him. Dubs in the comments if you a Black Clover fan, cuz we getting recognized).
5. Jayson Tatum- If Butler is a combination of Rock Lee and Asta, then I guess Tatum think he Deku cuz he thinking that the ""Mamba Mentality"" is like one for all (I know it is corny, and I am so sorry. But for real though, Tatum do be thinking he Kobe, which is not a knock against him, but still. Also, Deku's associated with Green and Tatum on the Celtics, so that reference is hopefully not completely off). Ignoring the corny ass anime reference (which hopefully at least one of y'all get), Tatum is without a doubt a budding star (hell, he is a borderline superstar at this point), and last season was officially his breakout year. In the 2019-20 season, Taco Jay averaged 23.4 points on 45.0% shooting from the field and 40.3% from three on 7.1 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.0 rebounds and dished out 3.0 assists, which earned him the accolade of third team all-NBA. He also contributed to a very elite perimeter defense that was in Boston, and grew to becoming the leader of that young Celtics team. Like Butler, Tatum turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 25.7 points on 43.4% shooting from the field and 37.3% from three on 7.4 attempts per game. He also grabbed 10.0 rebounds and dished out 5.0 assists a game, leading the C's to the Eastern Conference Finals, and were two games away from making the NBA Finals. So far into the young season, Tatum and the Celtics have been looking very good despite that rocky start to the season. This season, I expect the Celtics to take another step in the right direction and to see growth from both Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum (like, I know he grew more into a leader last season, but it always felt like he put up the stats, and guys like Brown, Smart, and Walker were the leaders of that team). I expect him to make an all-NBA, all-Defense (which he was lowkey snubbed for last season), and possibly get some MVP votes.
6. Paul George- I want to preface this by saying that this is not a knock against Mr. Playoff P. We all know that Paul George is going to be great in the regular season (I mean, mans right now is playing like an MVP Candidate, averaging 25.1 points on 50.8% shooting from the field, 49.2% shooting from three on 8.7 attempts per game, and 92.9% shooting from the charity stripe. He is also dishing out 5.1 assists and grabbing 5.7 rebounds per game. He also seems to have a better start with this Clippers team as opposed to last year, as he knows his role on the offensive and defensive side of the floor). But I am not gonna sit around and not mention the atrocity that was ""Pandemic P"" in last season's playoffs, which is the main reason why he is this far down. In the 2020 playoffs, Paul George averaged 20.2 points on 39.8% shooting from the field and 33.3% shooting from three on 8.5 attempts per game, brought down 6.1 rebounds, and dished out 3.8 assists per game. Basically mans switched from playing like an all-NBA player, to a bench player who was brought into the 15 man roster from the G-league, who is trying his hardest to stay on the team. Again, I am not implying that Paul George is bad (in fact, he is pretty good), but all I want from him is consistency. He needs to prove to the basketball community that he is a reliable option in the playoff, and that he isn't just a regular season player.
7. Brandon Ingram- Last year, Brandon Ingram officially had his breaking out season. After being traded to New Orleans from Los Angeles in the Anthony Davis trade, Ingram was able to flourish in his new playing environment. Although the Pelicans were a pretty underwhelming team (kinda falling sort of expectations I guess), Brandon Ingram did not disappoint, averaging 23.8 points on 46.3% shooting from the field and 39.1% shooting from three on 6.2 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.2 rebounds and dished out 4.2 assists per game, which earned him an all-star selection (also got some high respect from one Kevin Durant, noting that his game was very similar to his, saying that he has potential to be an elite player in this league), and won him the Most Improved Player award (although, I personally felt like it should have went to Bam Adebayo). Despite his statistical growth, he showed a lot of promise on the defensive end of the floor and he was able to be the go-to scoring option for this team down the stretch (basically, him being a jack of all traits player in the beginning of his career, which hurt him, is now pretty beneficial for him now). To start off this season, BI has looked strong, averaging 25.0 points on 44.8% shooting from the field and 38.6% from three on 6.3 attempts per game. He is also flourishing as a playmaker, averaging a career high 5.7 assists per game, while bringing down 6.4 rebounds per game. I expect the Pelicans to make some noise this season, and hopefully BI and Zion can lead this team to promising success in the future.
8. Khris Middleton- (These last three spots were very hard, so please do excuse me if I screw up here and there). Middleton finds himself here at number eight (like he is a good to great player and underrated, but at the same time, it really doesn't feel that way. Like, he is just an all-star player). If I were to just describe him, I guess all I can say is that he is somewhat of a second option to Giannis, in the fact that he scores his 20 points on good efficiency (to be more specific, he averaged 20.9 points on 49.7% shooting from the field and 41.5% shooting from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 6.2 rebounds, and had 4.3 assists per game). He is an above average defensive player and a vocal leader for this Bucks team. He has developed every single year in this tenure with the Bucks, and I expect nothing less from him this season as well (he is already averaging 20 points on 50-40-90 splits, so safe to say that he might end up being an all-star again if he keep this pace). His only problem is that of consistency, as like Paul George, Middleton struggled in the bubble, one of the main reasons why the Bucks were upset against the Heat in the second round. I expect the Bucks to remain competitive, and hopefully Middleton can find a way to solidify his position as the second star of this team.
9. Gordon Hayward- Despite that gruesome leg injury he suffered in the 2018 season and the rocky season he had in 2019, Hayward has relatively bounced back to being a productive starter to a borderline all-star type player. Last season he averaged 17.5 points on 50.0% shooting from the field and 38.3% from three on 4.3 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.7 rebounds and passed for 4.1 assists per game. He did not play a lot in the NBA playoffs, as he was coming off a grade 3 right ankle sprain which he suffered in the first round of the playoffs. He returned in game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, but he saw limited action, and the Celtics were taken out in 6 games. This season with the Hornets (who I really do not know where they will end up in the East), I expect to see increases in Hayward's stats (like as of right now, he is averaging 21.9 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 36.4% from three on 5.5 attempts per game. He is also averaging 5.8 boards a game and 4.4 assists per game). I highly doubt he will make an all-star tea, but I expect him to be some valuable veteran leadership for this young Hornets team.
10. Duncan Robinson- Robinson finds himself at number 10 to wrap up this list. It is pretty simple to explain his game: He is just a sniper bro. Last season, he averaged 13.5 points on 44.5% shooting from three on 8.3 attempts per game (which is crazy). He was integral to the Miami Heat's success, and although he is pretty shaky to start of the season and teams seem to be guarding him a bit tighter (he is still shooting like 41.1% from three), I expect him to good this season again. Him and Bam have good chemistry on those hand-offs by the elbows, so he will definitely get good looks from three. The Heat will make another run for it in the east, and I expect them and Robinson to turn it up when the time comes.

Honorable Mentions:

1. Robert Covington- I was debating between Roco and Robinson for the tenth spot. However, I looked into the Trailblazers roster, and he is playing the power forward this year (which I guess is expected based off his defense), so he is going to be in my power forward list.
2. Tobais Harris- Same thing I said with Roco. He plays heavy power forward minutes for the 76ers, a position that he blossomed in during his tenure with the Clippers under Doc Rivers, so expect to see him in the power forwards list
3. Joe Ingles- Again, very close with Robinson. But I went with Robinson based off how much he provided that Heat team with. The inside-out game plan of the heat was very fun to watch last year.
4. Andrew Wiggins- I do not know what the hell to expect from him at this point. One day he has an efficient game and the next he just bricks everything. He is very inconsistent
5. Michael Porter Jr.- Give him time. Just give him time and he will hopefully be a key piece to that Nuggets team.
6. T.J. Warren- Prayers up for a speedy recovery. That is all.

"Proven he could carry a mediocre team to a championship (2003), proven he could coexist with another superstar to win a championship (1999), proven he could consistently play well in the regular season (never missed playoffs, never had a season below 50 wins, two MVPs), had insane longevity (contended for 19 years straight, still a good player when he was old), won a lot of championships (5), coexisted with other stars and never had an ego in letting them share the glory (parker, Manu, Kawhi)

"The Bulls won 6 titles in 8 seasons with Pippen and he's no doubt a historically great player. But I don't think he had the scoring punch of Wade. I personally rate peak D Wade as a top 15-20 player of all time, top 25 at worst. From 2003 to 2011, he played at an insane level both on offense and defense. I don't think Scottie qualifies as such.","Who do you think was better, peak Dwyane Wade or peak Scottie Pippen?"

"I’ve never played professional basketball, so I don’t know if it’s an actual tactic to pressure the refs to blow the whistle your way more often? Or do players actually believe that they’re fouled on every play and never foul opponents?",Is constantly complaining to the refs a valid tactic? Or just players being competitive?

I feel like I have seen this almost happen many many times but I've never actually seen it happen. So many times guys fall in the paint and there's guys around him jumping for the rebound.,Has a player ever falling down on the court and then another player accidentally jumps on their head?
"In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals. What do you think cause the drastic change in strategy in what were both do or die games?

I know the Clippers are touted as having more offensive options than Toronto had, but there were plenty of raptors that could get their own bucket also in Lowry, FVV, and Siakam... which they all proved in the finals.","In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals.

"Who you got and why? I got manu as he has a more varied skill set, pass, shoot, defend, size, less quick but more athletic in other ways. Where as parker seems is not as much of a two way player, and was a worse shooter. I watched them solely in the playoffs, but am curious what others think.",Who would have had a better career if they did not play for the spurs Manu Ginobili or Tony parker?
"I know Spain/Argentina/France/Slavic countries all had amazing talent on their roster, but I think we’d be the only non-USA team to field an entire roster of rotation pieces on NBA teams.

- Jamal Murray
- SGA
- Lu Dort
- Andrew Wiggins

- RJ Barrett
- Chris Boucher

(Switch in Dwight Powell and NAW for some of the bigs if you want)","If every Canadian in the NBA is on board with playing in the olympics this year, would they be the most talented non-USA team ever?"
"Context:

&gt;Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future. Unlike other major revenue streams such as TV and ticket money, expansion fees are not split with players. Such a haul could mean about $160 million per team, a windfall that could wipe out the massive debt load that's piling up, and that alone has perked interest in the expansion path.

&gt;Considering there might be multiple offers from cities like Seattle or Las Vegas and that the league knows its business and its bidders, that could be a fair projection. But a potential Wolves sale of $1.5 billion or less would mean a correction in the NBA market after a decade of growth.

&gt;The Utah Jazz, who play in a much smaller market than Minneapolis, sold for $1.66 billion last month to tech billionaire Ryan Smith. That is a strong vote of confidence in the continued rise in franchise value -- but it might have been an outlier.

https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30652450/what-potential-timberwolves-sale-means-nba-expansion","[Windhorst] Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future."
"The NBA is already hard enough to watch right now because of the lack of crowds, and now we’re getting players resting on prime time games? It just stinks.

It makes sense for dudes like Demarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant and everyone that recently suffered serious injuries, but it doesn’t make sense to allow young healthy players to sit. Does the NBA just not care about the viewers? 

Maybe the solution is to significantly reduce the amount of games, and I’m okay with it. I’m all for *quality* over *quantity* in this instance. I’m a die hard Cavs fan, but I don’t watch close to every Cavs game because there are so damn many. I don’t think NBA fans would mind not having as many games if they actually got to see their favorite players play.",The NBA seriously needs to do something about resting players.
"I'll start, Wilt Chamberlain (flair checks out); not only was he an athletic freak of nature (most athletic player the sport has ever seen), he actually was very skilled at the game of basketball, he had a great post fade, was very nuanced in the post, and was a disciplined defender. There are some more deeper things i'd like to touch on but this is meant to be more for civil light discussion and not in depth analysis.",Which player has the most misconceptions attached to them?

"&gt;‘This is uncharted territory for most of us’ — Fred VanVleet on Raptors 1-5 start. ‘... we got a boatload of problems’

&gt;‘This game will break your heart ... this stuff keeps me up at night’ —
Fred VanVleet

Kyle Lowry chimed in on the Raptors issues as well

&gt;“Right now we have no swag to us ... teams are looking at us and saying let’s eat ... that’s not a good position at all’ — Kyle Lowry.

"So I heard a lot of stuff on how Levert is a really good player and will be the third star and all that stuff but so far he has looked pretty bad and has a abysmal TS. Now granted this is early and his percentages will might go up but as of now do you think he is overrated?

Just for reference Levert has the exact same TS as Siakam in the 2020 playoffs",Caris Levert so far this season 14.5/3.9/5.5 on 39/29/91 and a 46 TS%. Is he one of the most overrated players/assets in the NBA?

Herro: 14.3

Dragic: 13.8

Bradley: 13.0

Duncan: 11.2

Butler: 10.8

Olynyk: 10.4

Even with Butler's struggles due to his ankle injury, the Heat have had a ton of help from the supporting cast. Its impressive seeing such an ""everybody eats"" offense",The Heat currently have 7 players averaging double digits in ppg this season.
"After a rusty start to the season, DLo had his best game so far against Denver. Really loved to see his synergy with Vanderbilt and the fact that he got more to the FT line. 

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267264","DLo tonight vs. the Nuggets: 33 points and 11 assists on 10/21 FG, 4/9 3PT and 9-10 FT"

"Kyrie is simply too erratic and unpredictable, as good as he is on the court, he could very well just retire tomorrow with no given reason.

"Rubin had the opportunity to purchase the 76ers in 2011 when he was approached by then-majority owner Ed Snider. Rubin declined and months later joined the bid of Josh Harris and David Blitzer. Rubin is also executive chairman of Fantics.

“I only did it because David Stern told me to do it,” Rubin told Sports Illustrated. “Good owners aren’t buying franchises because they think it’s a good economic deal. They’re buying franchises because they’re a huge fan of the sport and they want to be a steward of that team. If they just do it because of a good economic deal, they’re going to be bad owners.”

Which of your teams and owners are you proud of or wish never happens.  

Tillman is a big inspiration for this, Sarver comes to mind. Reisendorf in 1998 is just unforgiveable .

"You can look at years where maybe one Conference was stacked af, but I don't remember the last time so many teams were enjoyable to watch imo and even if they're not going anywhere are worthwhile and dangerous on paper any given night. 

**The West:** Obviously the Clippers, Lakers, Jazz, Warriors, Blazers, Mavericks, Rockets(with Harden), Nuggets are good watchable teams in the West. The Suns have a really good crew this year too though with CP3/Booker/Mikal/Ayton etc. Obviously the Pelicans are a big attraction with playoff hopes. No one has the Wolves in the running, but a team on paper with DLo, Beasley, Rubio, KAT, Culver, and #1 pick AntEdwards is worth watching. I'd look forward to my Sixers playing them to see those guys, they have two stars and a potential third. The Kings and Spurs aren't *bad*, they have good watchable and interesting players, and when Morant and JJJ returns the Grizzlies are certainly a fun young team. The only team left out is the tanking OKC who at least is interesting in the long run with their haul of picks. That's the entire conference. 

**The East:** We're used to a stacked West, but the East is where things really change. Again, Sixers, Pacers, Celtics, Bucks, Heat, Nets were all obvious standout teams in the Conference. That being said, Orlando made the playoffs last year and is off to a good start, and the Cavs actually have an intriguing rotation with Sexland/Okoro/Love/Drummond and guys like KPJ/Cedi/Nance/McGee as well. I think the Hawks have a legit squad there, they look 10 deep to me when healthy with a young(get it) superstar to lead the way. The Hornets have Rozier/Graham/Hayward/Bridges in the starting 5 and LeMelo is a treat off-the-bench. The Bulls have Zach and Coby making an exciting backcourt, a high pick in PatWill, Lauri, Wendell, etc. The Wizards have a backcourt that can kill you any given night with Rui, Deni, Bertans, Thomas Bryant, etc. They aren't elite teams, but they're certainly watchable and they're not a joke imo. Toronto is struggling, but I'll still give them time to bounce back. They certainly have good players. I've covered everyone except the Knicks who are off to a good start, and Detroit is clearly tanking. I won't pass any judgement on the Knicks yet, but that's 13/15 teams I can confidently look at and like. 

When was the last time in the league where even if I'm being personally picky can look at let's say 25/30 teams and say they have good talent and are truly worth watching? I love where the NBA is at right now, I think so many fans have a reason to be excited about their teams. Almost no game feels like a free win coming into it. I personally really hope the league doesn't expand, because this is special.",Talent Distribution in the League is the BEST it's been in years
"Since guys like Pau Gasol and Tyson Chandler aren’t on a roster, that leaves LeBron, Melo, Korver, and Udonis Haslem as the only players that have been in the league since 2003. And because LeBron was taken 1st overall in the draft ahead of Melo and Korver,  and Haslem wasn’t signed until August, technically LeBron has been here longer than anyone else.

Truly insane that the best player in the league is also the league’s longest tenured.[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_and_youngest_National_Basketball_Association_players#)",LeBron James has actually been in the NBA longer than any other current player
"Obviously, the chances of either one of these individuals making it to the NBA is astronomically low, but I thought this would be a fun post. And G-league counts as ""making it"" in the NBA in this case. 

Julian Newman was ""hyped"" to be a type of scoring phenom, and played against varsity basketball players when he was just in fifth grade. He has a good amount of games of scoring a ton of points, but is quite the selfish player. Moreover, he is listed at just 5 foot 7 inches tall, and that even seems generous.

Rapper Sheck Wes played in basketball but didn't go to college. Despite that, he declared for the 2020 draft and no team picked him up. He's just 6 foot 2 inches tall, but still was able to sign for Paris Basketball in LND Pro B, which is a second tier professional basketball league in France. I couldn't find many videos of him balling, but apparently he's somewhat decentish.

So with all that said, who has the higher chance to make it?","Who has a higher chance of making it in the NBA, Julian Newman or Sheck Wes?"

Looking at this helps separate the 3 point era into 4 chunks.

We've got 80-94 where there was a gradual increase every year after the introduction of the 3 point line.

That blip from 95-97 when the NBA moved the 3 point line in to increase players taking the shot.

98-12 where there were small increases early before starting to plateau.

13-now where we've seen an explosion and substantial increases nearly every year in 3s taken.",Looking at the % of total shots taken from 3 year by year.
"Snippets from a new interview with Bogdan:

&gt; “When the news (of the alleged Bucks-Kings deal) came out, we were like, ‘What the fuck?’” Bogdanovic said during a half-hour phone conversation with The Athletic last week. “I didn’t know what was going on. I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure what was going on.”

&gt; ...while Bogdanovic didn’t clarify much about the Bucks’ involvement and why they appeared to believe he was willing to come their way, he made two other strong viewpoints very clear: **The idea that Antetokounmpo recruited him hard directly was overblown, and he wasn’t pleased at how the Kings be-traded him along the way**

&gt;Yes, you read that right. And in a weird sort of way, Bogdanovic’s made-up word made perfect sense.

&gt; “It’s not the part that you were traded (that bothered him),” he said. “But it’s more like you feel a little be-traded. No one let you know about it.”

&gt; ""I remember (the Kings) called me right after they were talking with Vlade — bla bla — and they said, ‘We still want to be the same team, we still want you to (be on the team). You’re a big piece of it, you’re a big part of it.’ Bla, bla, bla. ‘We want to keep you,’ and all those stories. You know, it just caught me off guard, really.

&gt; When someone breaks that trust level, when someone does that, from that point you don’t believe them anymore, you know?""

&amp;#x200B;

Curry can’t take 31 shots and attempt 19 free throws every game like he did on Sunday, but the Warriors do need him to dominate the ball more than he did in their first five games. Before Sunday, Curry touched the ball in the half court 31 times per 36 minutes, a lower rate than any season since Mark Jackson was still the head coach in 2013-14, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Even his brother, Seth Curry, averaged more half-court touches (33.2), as did 86 other players. That changed on Sunday, as Curry set season highs in total touches (88), half-court touches (44), and time possessing the ball (6.6 minutes).

The Warriors won’t and shouldn’t have Curry do his best James Harden impression by running countless pick-and-rolls and isolations. Taking on such a massive workload wouldn’t be wise for a 32-year-old with a lot of miles on his 6-foot-3, 185-pound body. But they do need a higher-usage version of Curry more often. This would mean having him serve as more of an on-ball creator, while balancing that role with his off-ball brilliance.",Stephen Curry was only averaging 31 touches per game on offense *(before 62 pt game) - less then Seth

"Let’s say the team is historically bad like the Process Era Sixers or the 2012 Bobcats, so they are starting from the ground up. 

Their GM is a Sam Presti-type, who swindles 9 unprotected first round draft picks from the same draft year from 9 Billy Kings - and they all turn into top ten picks, including their own.

Assume their scouting department is competent, and the Draft is neither historically good (1984, 1996, 2003) or historically bad (2000, 2013).

I think it was unfair a little bit because I didn’t even get a call or nothing (from the Kings) and it was 2 a.m. in my country (when the news broke). I was just confused. I remember waking up the next morning, seeing my phone just blowing up. ‘What was happening? What happened?’ Bla, bla, bla. Ah, you got traded to Milwaukee. I said, ‘Like, how can I get traded (when he’s a restricted free agent)?’

&gt;My agent was explaining the whole summer (that in) restricted free agency, we’re waiting for offers and that’s it, you know? If the Kings don’t want to give us a good offer, (or) they offer me the same money they offered me the last time and they didn’t want to go more than that, or they want me to check the market (that’s fine). They’d talked to my agent about checking the market, and I was fine. And then, that was the deal with the Kings. That’s what my agent told me. And I talked personally with them as well.

&gt;**So if I’m hearing you right, did you stop thinking about Milwaukee at that point because the league seemed determine to make sure that didn’t happen?**

&gt;Yeah, honestly, I didn’t even make a decision about it. It was three days where something is happening and I didn’t even decide nothing, you know? I wasn’t even involved. I wasn’t even involved, and it’s about me — which is crazy.

"For teams, it's the ultimate get out of jail free card in that they don't have to trade assets or pay off the rest of their contracts in the event of buyout or amnesty. For expansion teams, their incentive to get decent players since they're just starting up.

The obvious one for me off the bat is Kevin Love. The Cavs would have to trade draft picks and young players in order to trade Kevin Love. I don't think you can get anything of value for Kevin Love at this point in time. I still think he's a good player but I don't know if he's worth the 30 million that he's making at this point in time.

Al Horford has a good chance of not getting protected. The Thunder have somehow found a way to get first round picks in any circumstance. I just don't know why a team would trade for Al Horford at this point in time due to his age.

Another one is probably John Wall. It really depends on where the Rockets are at that point in time. If Harden is traded and they're rebuilding, Wall could be gone. Most of it depends on how they want to build their roster going forward.

Tobias Harris is a possible candidate. I think Tobi is good but they're basically paying LeBron money for a borderline All-Star in the East. Philly could just use the expansion draft as a way to create cap space to get more depth if needed. This one really hinges on whether Philly believes they can get something of value for him in a trade.

If the Clippers don't get past the second round again, Marcus Morris might not get protected. Marcus Morris is a decent player but paying him $16 million every year until he's 35 feels like an overpay.

What other players fall into this category?","If an expansion draft happens, which teams would take advantage of it by trying to get off bad contracts? Which players are in danger of not getting protected?"
"I was not following the Kings very closely at the time, but I seem to recall the Kings trading Cousins during the 2016-17 season to the Pelicans being a pretty big surprise.

"With 5 minutes 39 seconds remaining in the 4th quarter the Grizzlies were given a 3 second defensive violation.  In every box score/play by play I’ve seen (espn, bballref, nba.com) Dennis Shroder is credited with attempting and making the free throw.  From watching the game I’m almost positive it was actually AD who took that free throw.  If that is the case his totals for the game should be 3-4 FT and 27 total points, not 2-3 and 26 as box scores currently show.  Does anyone have tape of the game and if I’m correct how would I go about letting these stats providers know there is a mistake?",Incorrect Box Score From Last Night’s Lakers/Grizzlies Game
"Is there any good reason why it wouldn't be a good idea to only award FTs to attempts that make it to the rim or if the player is tied up at the rim after a clear path or something. If the ball doesn't hit the rim on a shooting foul, it's a side OB with 14 or 24s on the shot clock. This way, we don't have to change the way in which offensive players use FTs for efficiency, but it will disincentivize the really blatant shot fake 3pt fouls where the shooter literally jumps into the flying defender and flails the ball 20ft away from the rim. I just think that type of foul should only be awarded if the shot was headed for the basket.",A possible way to easily reduce the amount of FT stoppage in modern NBA games

&gt; **We (Thanasis and Bogdanovic) are friends. We are friends, you know? I talked with him once monthly, once every two months.

This is the perfect year to take a gap year for Toronto. There are basically no fans this year, and on top of that the Raptors are playing in Tampa f\*\*\*ing Bay. I can't imagine this is a fun season for any of the players, especially those with homes in Toronto. It's not fair for them but I wouldn't be surprised if some players would rather get this season over with before the playoffs anyway.

Toronto has a promising young core. Fred, OG, Pascal (who I still believe in) are all locked up for the long haul. Why not get a chance to draft a superstar with a top 5 pick in a loaded draft? I don't even remember the last time Toronto was in the lottery (which is a compliment.)

"With expansion seeming more and more imminent by the day due to the losses the NBA needs to make up as a result of the pandemic, it is interesting to think about how the NBA will restructure after potential expansion. I've seen a good amount of proposals for realignment, but I believe this plan makes the most sense in terms of travel and historical precedent. This is of course assuming that the cities chosen are Seattle and Las Vegas, which I believe to be, by far, the most likely cities to get a team. Any other city is a long shot and would have to replace Las Vegas. 

The proposal involves 4 divisions of 8 teams in the traditional Western and Eastern Conferences and returns the NBA to a pre-2004 structure. The playoffs would be structured also like pre-2004 in which the division winners take the top 2 seeds, with the next 6 teams being ranked by their record. This gives meaning to the divisions along with encouraging divisional rivalries, which is something that is currently lacking in the NBA. This system also ensures that if the two best teams in a conference are in the same division, they will still have the opportunity to meet in the Conference Finals. The only downside, at least in the first couple seasons, is that both expansion franchises would be in the same division, but this is unavoidable unless Las Vegas is replaced with a city such as Montreal or Louisville.

My idea for the schedule is that each team would play 5 games against all 7 teams in their division (35 games), 4 games against 7 teams in the other conference division and 3 games against the remaining team in that division (31 games), and only 1 game against each team in the other conference (16 games), for the same normal 82 games that the league will never relinquish because of revenue. I'm 99% sure this idea would never be implemented but it's still an interesting concept that would really turn up the heat with divisional rivalries. 5 games against divisional foes would allow for 2 two-game mini-series plus a final meeting for each matchup during the regular season, which ensures that there would be a regular season ""winner"" for each matchup. These 5th games could all take place at the end of the season to make tiebreakers and division title races that much more intense, similar to how the NFL does it at the end of their seasons. I think the best part about this, however, is that it would decrease overall travel, which would better the quality of play and (maybe) decrease the amount of injuries we see.

# Pacific Division (Western Conference)

*This division is the Pacific Division of the pre-2004 NBA along with the addition of Las Vegas. It restores some old divisional rivalries that were broken up by realignment in 2004 such as Lakers-Blazers along with restoring the late 60s expansion trio of Seattle-Phoenix-Portland, who all 3 had multiple classic playoff series between each other during the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Finally, Las Vegas can form a desert rivalry with Phoenix and possibly an I-15 rivalry with the LA teams as well.*

# Southwest Division (Western Conference)

*This is the spiritual successor to the original Midwest Division that existed for 34 years, that pulls every team from the current Southwest Division plus 3 teams from the Northwest that are geographically Southwest. OKC finally is with the teams that they have had memorable playoff series with such as Houston, San Antonio, and Memphis. With Utah moving into this division, it keeps the possbility for a real Jazz-Nuggets rivalry along with strengthening the hatred between Jazz and Rockets fans. Travel would be a bit long from places like New Orleans/Memphis to Utah, but the historical precedent is there for Utah to be in this division (they were in the Midwest from 1979-2004) and New Orleans/Memphis will still have OKC and the Texas teams as close cities.*

Dallas Mavericks

San Antonio Spurs

Houston Rockets

New Orleans Pelicans

# Central Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Central Division of the 90s minus Toronto and plus Minnesota, which will make travel far less tedious for the Timberwolves. This gives them the opprotunity to develop rivalries with teams that actually make sense for them, possibily mirroring NFC North rivalries. Charlotte and Atlanta may not make too much sense in terms of travel for this division, but both were in this division throughout the 90s with Atlanta going as far back as 1970. In my opinion, this historical precedent outweights removing a team like Toronto from the Atlantic and putting them here, given the great playoff series the Raptors have had with current divisional rivals (BOS, PHI) in recent years.*

Minnesota Timberwolves

# Atlantic Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Atlantic Division pre-2004 with the addition of the Raptors. I don't think breaking up the Southeast Division is too big of a deal given that Atlanta doesn't really have animosity towards Miami or Orlando that I know of. This also re-introduces the possbility for another Heat-Knicks rivalry one day which would be great for the league.*

Ultimately, this turned out to be a legendary performance. Some of you may remember back when the Western Conference really *did* make it impossible for you to succeed. The San Antonio Spurs were just as good as that extraordinary Kobe-Shaq Lakers team in some ways and also one of the best teams in the league for more than a decade. That ultra gritty, slowly grind your spirit into the ground type of culture was fueled by Duncan, Parker, and Ginobli, but was captained by a prime Gregg Popovich. They happened to come up against the Phoenix Suns in the 2010 playoffs and it would be no easy task, especially at the end of Game 3. This would be thoroughly proven when a European kid with very little playoff experience, and vicious fire in his eyes, gave the world something special to witness.

"Or rostered within the past couple of seasons, it doesn’t particularly matter. I’m looking solely for obscurity, not a commentary on the skill level of any specific player. I’ve been considering many different people for this designation, but have decided based on a combination of factors that this honor belongs to **Khem Birch**. 

I first learned this person existed close to the trade deadline last season. Upon further research, I’ve found that his entirely uninspiring numbers and limited role on a seldom-watched team have resulted in Khem Birch generating almost zero buzz over his flavorless four year career. I would wager that he has the least name recognition of any player in the league that actually sees minutes. 

Can anyone top the obscurity of the elusive Khem Birch?",Who is the most random/obscure player currently in the NBA?
"I haven't watched too many Jazz games, but from what I've heard from Jazz fans and my limited time watching him, it seems he provides

"Hi guys, I wanna ask about NBA standings.

I know about the tiebreakers when the regular season ends and how they determine who’s gonna make it to playoff. 

What I wanna ask is: How do they rank teams who have the same W-L record when the regular season is still going? For example, in the Western Conference, there are currently 5 teams with 3-4 record, how do they rank these teams? Are there any criteria or they just put whoever get the record first on top?

I know this is super temporary and subject to change very soon after a few more games, and it does not matter that much at the beginning of the season (like now). But still I’m curious and I really want to know. I tried a Google search but all of the results seem to be end-season/playoff criteria.

"That draft class was the 1970 class, which included the legends **Bob Lanier**, **Pete Maravich**, **Geoff Petrie**, and **Dan Issel**.

Surprisingly enough, this draft class followed the year when Kareem-Abdul Jabber got drafted, so true situational irony where the the best offensive draft-class occurred after arguably the GOAT. 

Other years with multiple 20+ ppg scorers:

Year | Players 
:- | :-
1960 | Oscar Robertson, Jerry West 
1965 | Rick Barry, Billy Cunningham
1966 | Dave Bing, Lou Hudson
1970 | Pete Maravich, Bob Lanier, Geoff Petrie, Dan Issel
1972 | Julius Erving, Bob McAdoo
1974 | George Gervin, John Drew
1975 | David Thompson, World B Free
1976 | Alex English, Adrian Dantley
1977 | Marques Johnson, Bernard King
1984 | Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley
**Lottery Era** | **Players**
1985 | Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone
1996 | Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson

Not many surprising names on there, but it is surprising there are only two draft classes to produce more than 2 20+ ppg scorers.  It’s also surprising how after the lottery was introduced, everything changed to such an extent. It’s pretty mind-boggling.

Also keep in mind there’s many players right now who would fit these categories, but I decided to leave them off because their careers are not finished yet.

Something else that’s interesting is **1950-1953, 1954, 1957, 1963, 1964, 1967, 1971, 1979-1981, 1986, 1989-1991, 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2002** were the draft classes that didn’t produce *any* career 20+ ppg scorers. There were multiple with only one player, like 1992 with Shaquille O’ Neal.","[OC] From 1949-2003, Only 1 Draft-Class Produced More Than 3 Career 20+ PPG Scorers"

"I’m watching the Minnesota game and Denver just committed some sort of violation. I didn’t know what it was because I didn’t hear the whistle, I only saw the Denver players complaining in in unison and the ball switched sides.

I also noticed this happening sometimes in the Nets game, where I had to judge based off the player’s reactions, not the whistle.

Is this happening to anyone else? Might be because the synthetic crowd noises and music on the court are crazy loud.",Are the referees audible?
"If Seattle gets a team what does that mean for record books? And can they be named SONICS?

With Okc still in league, anyone have a good guess or a real answer on what would happen?

I think they would have to change their name and not be considered champions. I’m from Oregon would be great to get the PNW rivalry going. 

Thanks in advance",If Seattle gets a team what would that mean for the record books.
"As a new fan, I find it difficult to enjoy games and therefore feel less likely to watch future games. After watching the NBA for around 6 months, I find it very difficult to enjoy the game when I feel like the rules are arbitrary and difficult to understand in real-time.

I started watching the NBA after getting laid off from my banking job soon after the bubble restart. While I quickly picked up another job, I found that I wouldn't start until April and therefore had a significant amount of time for new hobbies. I quickly dove into the NBA and NHL to fill what previously was 100+ hour work weeks, watching every game I could and trying to understand as much as possible. 

Over the last 6 months, I have thoroughly enjoyed the bubble format of the NBA. The Lakers became my favorite team because of their lockdown defense (I'm currently enjoying watching the sixers more) and I went from illegally streaming games to paying for league pass.

However, I've come to a point where I feel like I should really understand what is a foul and what isn't, but being completely surprised 30-50% of the time a whistle is blown. The problem is two-fold. First, NBA broadcasts rarely show replays of fouls. While I understand there is significant fluidity to the game, it makes it difficult as a fan to come to see what is going on at a speed that I can digest it. Also, it makes it difficult to learn and understand the game as a fan. In contrast, the NHL shows replays of almost every penalty, and while there are still controversies, I feel like I can get a better understanding of the game and that rules are more fairly applied.

Tonight I had significant difficulty understanding and watching the lakers/grizzlies games due to the aforementioned issues. As a new fan, I find these incongruencies frustrating and am looking forward to the NHL start as a replacement for the NBA product.","The NBA product as a new fan, and why fouls are frustrating"
"Last night, I was watching the second half of the Pacers Pelicans game and I noticed something small I wanted to write about - I saw that the Pelicans’ closing lineup (Ball/Redick/Ingram/Williamson/Adams) ran a specific set a few times in order to get Ingram the ball in a position he likes. It looks like they start in a [box set](https://i.imgur.com/1cVZInN.jpg). Notice that **Ingram** is on the left low block and **Adams** is on the left elbow.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a [video](https://streamable.com/01zdc7) showing the 3 plays they ran out of this set.

&amp;nbsp;

To get into the box set, Lonzo brings the ball up, usually either down the middle or left side of the court. Adams goes to the left elbow, sets a back screen for Ingram who cuts to the left block. Then, Adams sets a down screen for Ingram, who comes off the screen ready to catch the ball on the left wing facing the basket (the videos show the action a lot better than my description). 

This action usually flows into an Ingram/Adams pick-and-roll on the left wing, or just an Ingram isolation. The unsung part of the play that really makes it work (in my opinion) is the way that the two other players, JJ Redick and Zion, are used. They usually don’t do much besides maybe screening for each other (to get Zion an easy dive to the rim or Redick a 3), but the threat of a Redick catch-and-shoot 3 or a Zion lob causes defenders to be more wary of them and prevents them from sending too much defensive attention to Ingram.

It seems like the best way to guard this is by using Lonzo’s man to dig down while Ingram has the ball and this could possibly blow up the pick and roll with Adams.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my summary of the three examples of the play in action during yesterday’s crunch time possessions:

&amp;nbsp;

[Possession 1](https://streamable.com/7r1jgz)

[Possession 2](https://streamable.com/vnv5lw)

[Possession 3](https://streamable.com/3madve)

&amp;nbsp;

In the first possession, the play flows into an Ingram/Adams PnR and Sabonis (Adams’ man) drops back to cover the Adams roll, Brogdon is caught up a little on the screen and neither man can credibly contest Ingram’s pull up jumper in the paint. Both McDermott and Sampson keep a careful watch on their own assignments and are unable to help much. Notably, McConnell (Lonzo’s man) is mostly out of the play. Result: **Ingram 2 pt basket on open paint jumper.**

&amp;nbsp;

In the second possession, the play again flows into the PnR action, and Brogdon is again slowed down by Adams’ excellent (totally not moving) screen. Adams’ man, this time Myles Turner, hedges to prevent the Ingram open 3, Ingram reads the play excellently and hits Adams on a dive to the rim. Notice that Justin Holiday (Lonzo’s man) digs down but since Turner is out of position Holiday and Sabonis can’t get there to help in time. Result: **Steven Adams dunk off pass from Ingram**

&amp;nbsp;

The third possession is an example of the play getting blown up. Lonzo’s man (Oladipo this time) digs down again as Ingram has the ball, but Adams decides not to set the screen (not exactly sure why) to give Ingram an isolation look with Brogdon. However, Adams’ man (Turner) is in an excellent position to wall Ingram off from the basket and then Oladipo’s positioning comes in handy once Ingram tries to go the other way. Brogdon does a great job of containing Ingram with the help of his teammates here. Result: **Ingram misses contested midrange jumper**",[OC] Pelicans late game offense: Using a box set to strengthen the Ingram/Adams two man game
"This is one aspect of his game I have wanted to monitor, considering how mediocre he was from three point range at UGA (29% on 8 attempts per game).  

Early returns are.... well basically what you would expect.  Dude needs to dial it back a notch with this Westbrook-esque bricklaying .","Anthony ""A1"" Edwards 3pt shooting this season: 29% on 6 attempts per game"
"Title explains itself

 Mines include 

Both Damian lillard buzzer beaters against Houston and OKC

Curry vs Okc 2016 

Kawhi Leonard's 2019 against the 76ers 

Jordan's 1989 buzzer beater vs the cavs 

Kobe 2009 vs D wade and the miami heat 

Theres alot more to cover and I cannot list them all 

What is yours?

Edit: I forgot Drose against Cleveland 2015

Edit II: last second shots count also idc",What is the best buzzer beaters in your opinion?
So Lou averages 52% FG when he makes the first shot and just 32% when he misses the first shot which is just absolutely insane. Does this theory apply to other players as well?,Is the lou Williams first shot theory real for other players too?
"He's legitimately been playing like a top 20 player for about the last 3 seasons, was an allstar in 2018 and should have been in 2019 (over Sabonis imo) and is probably the only reason Orlando hasn't been in the lottery the past 3 years. Orlando won't be bad this year that they would trade him and the Jrue Holiday trade probably upped his value because he has more term and is a better player which another team probably wont wanna pay the price. Its crazy the shift he had from an above average center from 2012 to 2017 to maybe the 4th best (after Embiid, Jokic, Gobert , and KAT in no particular order).",Is Nikola Vucevic the most underrated player in the nba?

"I was beginning to work my night ""shift"" and I was set to watch Nets vs Jazz, but I decided to switch to Lakers vs Grizzlies because of the commentator and play by play. He used to be the lead commentator on NBA and NFL on our ESPN (I'm from Brazil), now he's on another channel, but still on a NBA task. I usually don't pick a game just because of broadcasting in Portuguese, but whenever he is on the booth, I pick that game.

Do you have a favorite broadcast crew that you follow, no matter the game? Or vice versa, a crew that you hate so much that you skip every possible game with them on the booth, or just downright mute the broadcast?",Have you ever watched a game just because of the broadcast crew?
"Whether it be at some point this season, the playoffs, or the early part of next season, im just wondering how long the NBA is going to have empty arenas. What do you say?",Buy or Sell: We will see full NBA arenas again in 2021?
"He’s definitely regressed from 2016, but he is the absolute king of the little things that makes life much easier for Steph. Can run Kerrs offense which allows Steph to run off screens all day. Still a good defender and solid rebounder. Definitely still a solid player and Great rebounder for his size, and also can run plays for the warriors.",Draymond Green makes everyone on the Warriors so much better on both ends of the floor
"Been trying to find this out for about a year. They play it during intros, commercial breaks, etc. What song is it? I can't Shazam it because they're usually talking over it

Edit: Found it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXRCl3CR9v0",What's that rock music they use on NBA TV a lot? They just used it while talking about the Lakers

"Helped lead a comeback victory over the Hawks. I'm excited about this team, it seems like we have a lot of good young talent.",Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley played the entire fourth quarter tonight and finished with 16 points on 4/7 shooting from the field and 2/3 from 3
"He’s been out even during the pre season with “knee soreness” but to be out that long with that injury title is kinda weird. 

Batum has stepped up in his absence getting starter minutes but I assume he heads to the bench once Morris comes back (no way they payed him 16M to come off the bench) which could ruin his rhythm

It’s early but Batum looks like a better fit with Kawhi and PG so Ty Lue will have some decisions to make",So what happened to Marcus Morris?
"[Link to Gobert's response](https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/1346138503319576576?s=20)
In light of Shaq claiming he would destroy him in his [Instagram post](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eq5m7bGUcAIP7fl?format=jpg&amp;name=large), Rudy Gobert has been getting pretty unnecessary hate from many people on social media, safe to say, he's pretty overhated at the moment as a result of his large contract. I don't think its unreasonable to call him overpaid, but I wouldn't fault a player for accepting that kind of money.","Rudy Gobert responding to the Shaq ""beef"" on Twitter: ""There is no beef. If people wanna keep speaking negatively about me or keep discrediting what i do it’s on them and all that does is show who they are. I will always be happy for a brother beating the odds. And i’m gonna keep beating the odds."""
"Personally I believe Wilt and Bird come in as the next players who could earn this title, with Duncan and Magic slightly behind those 2, but i'm curious to see who your runner ups to the GOAT debate are behind the big 3.","Besides Jordan, Kareem, and Lebron, who do you think has the best case for GOAT?"
"If Raptors decide to tank for a season, who can give the raptors a good package for Lowry? Shams has stated that the market for Lowry is good and raptors can get a good value for him..",Realistic Trade offers for Kyle Lowry?
"Just curious what everyone has to say. Thought this would be a fun little idea for some discussion. Let me know who would you buy and  sell stock in!

I’m a long term Knicks stockholder so I’d definitely be adding more Knicks stock to make up for years of losses!",Let’s say all NBA teams are stocks. What are some teams you’d buy stock in for the next 5 years and some teams you’d sell stock in?
"[Posted this on his IG story about an hour ago.](https://i.imgur.com/JOeQiW7.jpg)

Tob slander permanently cancelled.",Tobias Harris confirmed to at least be aware of r/Sixers
"Jaylen Brown has remarkably improved on his game every season thus far, and it doesn't look like it's gonna stop anytime soon. After playing sub-star level last season and then playing like a star in the playoffs, he seems to have fully established himself as a star in the league this season thus far.

Ben Simmons has barely improved on offense in any meaningful way 4 years in the league, but his defense has improved to a perennial all-defense and fringe DPOY caliber player. Unlikely he improves much on his offense going forward after little improvement in 4 years. 

Who do you think will be regarded as the better player at the end of this season?",Who do you think will be regarded as a better player after this season: Jaylen Brown or Ben Simmons

"In the NBA draft we see a lot of raw, unpolished talent selected high in the draft because they have the potential to get better at the game when they get some experience and NBA training instead of being expected to be a solid contributor from their first season and get better.

In my opinion, some examples of project players in recent drafts are guys like Aleksej Pokusevski, who are expected to become starting caliber players in some years. 

So, according to you, who is a ""project"" who panned out?

Edit: /uBlankVoid2979 explained it better, saying ""A project is someone with high potential but they're very raw and are not very good at the time of the draft"".","Since the year 2000, which draft picks regarded as ""projects"" panned out?"

Going to be another sky fucking night","Curry at the half: 23 points on 7/11 FG, 4/7 from 3, 5/5 from the free throw line"
Just based off experience and knowing what they're capable of doing. They've seen it all in the last 6 years. They have nothing to fear whereas a team like the Clippers have everything to prove. I would not want to play them in the first or second round even if they were a low seed. They have less expectations and less pressure to win but they're gonna bring that same intensity like they do in the past even if they aren't as good. I would treat them the same as if they were still that 73-9 team.  I feel they would have the psychological advantage over most teams. Just the fear of what Curry can do is enough to make you doubt yourself.,Are the Warriors a low key threat if they make the playoffs as a low seed?

"I feel like there hasn't been a nationally televised game on TNT, ESPN or ABC since like Christmas. What's up with that? I don't get NBATV so I've only been able to watch my local team's games, which sucks, and I feel like if I drop $60 for NBATV streaming then all of a sudden all the games I want to watch will be on TNT or ESPN again.",Why no national games outside of NBATV?
"It is not an easy decision due to how much the game has changed and how much guards are expected to score and shoot now. 

Out of these who would you take over Stockton: Dame, Trae, Harden, Luka, Steph, Kyrie, Westbrook.

CP3 is close to stockton's playstile so he is a case of which player you prefer and not which playstyle you prefer.

What is your prefered playstyle for your PG? What traits would you look for in your PG for the modern NBA?","Who would you rather have for your team: Stockton a pass first traditional PG elite on both ends, or a modern day score first PG that might not be as good defensively?"
Thunder lost 2 all stars for Paul George. It seemed like a cradle robbery at the time but now looking back pg left soon and Dipo/Sabonis are all stars. Do the thunder do the same move now? George is the best player of the 3 but 2 all stars &gt; 1.,"If Thunder knew about Sabonis and Dipo development, would it still be a good move to get Paul George?"
"Title pretty much says it all. What moments in NBA history do you feel are under appreciated, whether it be a game, trade, signing, or a stretch of games.

For me it’s Jimmy Butler in the 2020 NBA finals. Particularly games 3 and 5. It was special for me because it wasn’t a product of supernova shooting like Lillard and Harden are one to produce, or spurred on by supreme athletic dominance like Giannis. Hell, even though Jimmy’s a smart player, he wasn’t even outsmarting the other team (ie. LeBron, Jokic, CP3). He was just willing his team to victory in a way I’ve never really seen. It’s cliche, but this is the ultimate example of wanting it most (not that LeBron and the Lakers didn’t want it). It was made all the more powerful by game 6 where it was clear he was a dead man walking. You can even see in the start of this season that he really gave every ounce of himself to win those games.

Also, for a one game example, my favorite underrated game is Kobe dropping 42 in the first half against the Wizards on March 28th, 2003. I was never and still am not exactly a Kobe fan, but it was in my opinion the best half of basketball I’ve ever seen.

Edit: in case it wasn’t clear, it can be recent too, “historical” is honestly just anything before this season.",What are your favorite moments in NBA history that are historically underrated?
"The Spurs still have the narrative of a plodding team, but they played the fastest pace during the bubble.  They are playing uptempo again this year despite playing the majority of their games against some of the slowest in the league (Nola, Utah, LAL twice).

What don't people realize about your team?  I'd like to know the things that the stats, the national broadcaster, or the r/nba frontpage don't tell me.",What specifics of your team are others getting wrong so far this year?
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pokusal01.html. 
  
I know it's harsh to pick on rookies but I'm just hoping to see some answers that can encourage me that this guy won't be a total bust. His body doesn't exactly look NBA ready and the current shooting of 2/21 from the field and 1/16 from three with many misses barely touching the rim is far from promising. I think Jamal Murray started his career 0/16 so that's the best answer to the question I can think of but are there anymore?",[Serious] What are the worst starts to an NBA career in a players first 5 games? Currently Aleksej Pokusevski has recorded 10 turnovers and 5 points on 9/6/- shooting splits in 80 minutes.
Do you y'all think it's fair to compare Zach Lavine to Prime Carter? Same player build and archetype.,Zach Lavine comparable to Vince Carter?
"As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%).

McCollum has made 28-65 of his shots beyond the arc while Nurkic has been 6-14 from the line. 

https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers","As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%)."
"That's all.

You want more? Terrence Davis is on the outs with the Raptors anyway right? Or better yet, Kyle Lowry could keep them in the playoffs. Meanwhile the Raptors could stand to get rid of one of those two. Not like they're competing this year anyway.","Orlando Magic should trade for Kyle Lowry or Terrence Davis, and Raptors should blow it up."
"I'm just watching the Hawks struggling to score 10 points in a quarter right now and they are actually pathetic. No flow offensively and giving up offensive rebounds for fun. The team has lost to the Cavs, Knicks and should lose comfortably to the Hornets. Just like last season, they are the ultimate pretenders after 3-4 games and will struggle to win 25 games again.  

As for Bogdanovic, the less said about him the better. The Bucks absolutely dodged a bullet. I will give him time to adjust but the guy looks nowhere near a 20m/year player",The Hawks are nowhere near a playoff team and Bogdanovic might be the most overrated free agent signing of the off-season.
"
Draymond Green 4/6/6 on 33/0/66 shooting and tied for a game worst -11 in 31 minutes tonight. The backpack has yet to be unhitched as Draymond Green continues to struggle to be able to score

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267276",Draymond Green 4/6/6 on 33/0/66 shooting and tied for a game worst -11 in 31 minutes tonight
Whenever I see threads on this subreddut or even articles from ESPN about the best Eastern team at a shot to win the chip it feels like the pacers are almost never mentioned. The starting 5 seems so balanced and with how Sabonis and Oladipo are playing it seems like they could potentially have 2 all star players.  I feel like the team doesn't have a glaring weakness that some of the other contending east teams do.,Are the Pacers the most underrated team in the east?

"Anybody know the rules surrounding the play in tournament and the lottery?

If you make it to the play in as a 9th or 10th seed, win, then reach the playoffs, are you out of the lottery selection? Do you stay at your previous standings position but are just not included in the drawing? Or do you stay locked into both no matter what happens?

"George hill, imo, is the most obvious and likely player who will be traded at the trade deadline this season.
The thunder are clearly in rebuild mode and are in asset accumulation mode and we know how much Presti loves his draft picks.

Hill should be of interest to most contenders because of what he brings to the table as a player, locker room vet, and his contract is great.

Hill’s contract: This season George Hill will make a fully guaranteed  9.5 million dollars which is a good price. However next season Hill is making 10 million dollars with only 1 million guaranteed so if a team doesn’t like his performance, they can waive him without taking a big cap hit. 

Hill as a player: George Hill is known for being an elite shooter and a solid defender. Last season with the Bucks he led the league in 3pt shooting as he shot 46% from deep. This season, he is shooting 43% from 3 which is still great. 
Hill isn’t the best playmaker but he isn’t bad by any means as he’s averaged over 3 assists in the past couple of season while playing under 25 min a game.


I think Hill could help the Nets now that Dinwiddie is out. 
If the Clippers want to move on from Lou Williams, then Hill would be a great replacement.
The Celtics could also use George Hill.

Ultimately, these teams would probably have to add draft capital to entice OKC.

"At this point I think it should be accepted that second round pick Nikola Jokic is both the best passing center we’ve ever seen, as well as one of the greatest offensive centerpieces in the game today. His skill set is mesmerizing, blending skill size and intelligence which has already been shown to elevate in the playoffs. Early on in the season, this dude is averaging 22 points, 11 rebounds, and almost 13 assists. Stats on this level are unsustainable, and the season is young, but does he have a legit shot at being the third player ever to average a triple double over the course of a season? 

The first direction in answering this has to be looking at Westbrook’s run from 2017 until the end of his Thunder tenure. Denver’s performance as a team will likely be one of the biggest factors in wether or not Jokic can accomplish this feat. The limitations of the post Durant-Thunder roster called for Westbrook’s direct involvement every trip down the floor. Not only was he allowed to dominate the ball... they needed him to. Denver’s roster is much better, and they have a legitimate co-star for Jokic who will have the ball in his hands a lot throughout the season, but we’ve already seen the Nuggets heavily lean on their superstar center to start the year. Additionally, if we can be honest with ourselves, Westbrook’s personality surely played a role in this statistical feat, and I don’t think Jokic will care about his stats enough to hunt them out as the season goes down the stretch. With that said, Jokics passing is always in such a flow within the offense, it may not be such a challenge for him.

Look, do I think it will happen, probably not. But I swear I have never seen someone like this guy play basketball. He’s fucking different, and I think an MVP season could be in the cards regardless. Jokic certainly has a chance to make some history in his career, and honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a part of it.",Jokic on triple double watch for the season?
Disastrous offseason for the jazz overpaying 2 borderline all stars to massive deals. The organization will be hamstrung for a long time with these massive deals. What can the jazz do to get out of these awful contracts? Maybe they can give picks to okc and dump these contracts,The jazz are paying donovan mitchell over 30 million a year and he’s shooting 38% from the field
"It feels like cp3 can do anything on a basketball court, from running the PNR, having a money midrange game, deadeye passer, high assist to turnover ratio, and very vocal as well. Also, his defensive instincts are insane, for a guy of his height to guard legit wings/guards in this league in the post is absurb.. who else do you guys feel are underrated in terms of having a complete arsenal?",Is Cp3 underrated in terms of having a complete arsenal both offensively and on defense?
Just seen an article saying something along the lines of James Harden ball hogging and being selfish like A.I was. I'm too young to have had the pleasure of watching Allen Iverson play so I was just wondering if there was truth to that comment?? Was AI a selfish player?,Was A.I a selfish player?
Let's say the offensive team tries to dunk the ball but blows it massively. The ball touches nobody on either side and reaches the backcourt. Can the offensive team grab that ball because it hit the rim?,Is it a backcourt violation if the ball hits the rim but nobody touches it until it reaches the back court?

"The Knicks are currently the 11th best defense by defensive rating, but teams are shooting an unsustainably low 29.5% from three against them. There are a lot of smart people who believe that defenses can't affect how 3 point shooters shoot, there are also a lot of smart people who believe that smart teams know which threes to give up, or contest better. The Celtics, i think, had a low defensive 3pt% for years. 

Nevertheless, here's how teams would look assuming teams shot league average 3pt percentage against them. The formula is taking (Defensive 3pt% - Average 3 pt%)\*(Defensive 3pt attempt rate)\*(100) to get the D rating adjustment. All the data is taken from basketball reference.

"Every time I come to this sub during or after a Suns game this season, theres MAYBE 1 highlight, let alone no other post really talking about them. Hell, i dont even think theres a post game thread up right now for them.

I just started following them really this season, and im sure they prefer to stay low-key with no hype, but damn y'all aint doing them any justice.",The Suns are criminally underrated on /r/nba.

"From Jason Jones, Sacramento Kings NBA writer for the Athletic

“I don’t think anybody’s out there playing basketball worried about two tweets. And if you are, this ain’t what you should be doing because muthafuckas gonna tweet you everyday of your life while you’re playing in this league.""
De'Aaron Fox","De'Aaron Fox on online strangers commenting on his game: ""I don’t think anybody’s out there playing basketball worried about two tweets. And if you are, this ain’t what you should be doing because muthafuckas gonna tweet you everyday of your life while you’re playing in this league."""
Giannis is on a tear leading the Bucks into the second half while scoring 30 points out the 67 total points for the Bucks.,Giannis has 30 Points at the half against Detroit with 12/14 FG along with 3 rebounds and 2 assists
"I understand rivalries exist, but the hatred between Lebron and the Celtics seemed personal, especially in regards to Pierce and Garnett, both of which still talk smack about Lebron. Are they just salty Lebron was so successful?

Edit: Lebron is still successful.",Why did the Celtics hate Lebron so much?
"Some really good contenders for ROY already.  The young boys can play!  

Wiseman, Edwards, Pritchard...who ya got?",Who's your early pick for Rookie of the Year?
"The Greek Freak should also get some love here for having a near-perfect game last night, shouldnt he?

Source: https://www.nba.com/game/det-vs-mil-0022000099/box-score#box-score","Giannis Antetokounmpo obliterated Pistons interior defense, putting up a statline of 43/9/4 at 70% FG% (17/24) and made 7 out of 9 FTS!"
"Ewing, Riley, Starks, Oakley, Spike Lee, Reggie Miller, Michael Jordan, OJ..it all seems so cinematic reading up on it. Seeing Ewing and Oakley standing side by side, menacing, the core of an elite defense..I'd imagine it was a fascinating time to watch them.

EDIT: (A nice little add on to this post). Look through this gettyimages gallery of the time. Knicks, Spurs, Bulls players..celebrities court side. Really just a different time. Definitely worth a quick look through.

[https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/new-york-knicks-1990s?page=3&amp;phrase=new%20york%20knicks%201990s&amp;sort=mostpopular](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/new-york-knicks-1990s?page=3&amp;phrase=new%20york%20knicks%201990s&amp;sort=mostpopular)","What was it like watching the 90s Knicks (distinguishing between the Riley/Van Gundy tenures)?..talent, atmosphere, thoughts when seeing they were next up to face your team etc."
"To this day it stills bother me that Tony Parker left The Spurs after spending 18 seasons then ruining his farewell season by joining the hapless Charlotte Hornets. I wish he had a farewell tour in San Antonio along with Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan. It would've been a spectacle to watch Tony Parker, D. Wade and Dirk spend their last years in their home team in the same season.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I forgot it was The Charlotte Hornets..... My bad folks",Did Tony Parker slightly tarnished the image of his Legacy by joining the Charlotte Bobcats in his last year?
"Here are his season stats just for reference

22ppg 7 assists 11 rebounds 50/40/76 and 60% true shooting. 

Thibs is basically doing to Randle what he did to Noah. Where would you rank him?","Based only on what we've seen this season, where would you rank Julius Randle?"
Idk if anyone is watching but some serious shit is going down. Will NBA players want to take a break today so that it doesnt take attention away from how serious this is and how no one is being arrested or handled by the police.,Is there a chance games get cancelled today as a sign of protest?
"He had 25/5/6/2 on 8-17 shooting, 5-11 from three and 4-6 at the line.  
  
He had 15pts with 2:12 to go in the game and the Pacers were down 10. He proceeded to score 10pts in the final 2min of the 4th and then OT to help the Pacers win the game.",Oladipo tonight: 25pts | 5reb | 6ast | 2stl on 8-17
"I think it was Harden's coach last year talking about it. I'm assuming this is like points per possession and Harden's free throw shooting makes him the most efficient of all time?

EDIT: So I remember the coach saying that if you give Jordan and Harden the ball who produces the most points before you give it up.

I'm firmly a Harden hater don't worry about it I just want to understand what the argument is about.

EDITEDIT: So Harden has a higher eFG for many seasons but I'm not sure that was what was being referenced. And my understanding is the weighting changes the figures so it's era dependant(when you account free throws into the equation), but I'm not very knowledgable so...

EDITEDITEDIT: Another I found as I'm learning to use the stat sites is per 100 possessions Harden's highest is 2019 season 48 to Jordan's 46. And TS% .672 to Jordan's .614. It's probably one of these I was looking for. While I understand these are pure stats it's still affected by era with how foul calls work.","Can someone explain the numbers behind the ""James Harden is the greatest scorer"" argument?"
"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best\_NBA\_Player\_ESPY\_Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_NBA_Player_ESPY_Award)  


Unlike MVP/Finals MVP, it actually takes into account the whole season. So I feel it is more grounded in reality when it comes to judging who the best player in the world is. Unfortunately it only dates to 1993, so certain Michael Jordan seasons, Kareem's entire career, and many others all time greats missed out on the opportunity to receive one. Still, I think I personally prefer this award's objectivity over the MVP. I was amazed to find it was so obscure/little talked about.  


Thoughts?","What is your opinion on the ""Best NBA Player ESPY Award"""
"Who you got?

1. Harden
2. Lebron
3. Steph
4. KD
5. Jokic
6. Luka
7. Trae
8. Kyrie
9. Kawhi
10. Dame",Top 10 Offensive players in the league?
"I didn't even know this was a thing, until they posted a free article today: [https://cleaningtheglass.com/how-do-nba-defensive-rotations-work/](https://cleaningtheglass.com/how-do-nba-defensive-rotations-work/)

Free preview was pretty basic, no way I could justify throwing $99 on the full course...could I?",Any thoughts on the basketball Xs &amp; Os course from cleaningtheglass?
The Toronto Raptors have already exceeded their number of blown 10+ point leads from last season. Their record last year was 48-4 in such games and is 1-5 now.,An absolutely brutal stat about the Raptors
"A very solid game for Harris in the 76ers blowout versus the hornets, leading the team in scoring by a healthy margin. 22 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists and very efficient from the field (10/16), although he hasn't taken a single free throw the entire game. This is his 4th straight 20 point game, all four games shooting over 50%. He is proving to be a reliable scoring option under his favorite coach, Doc Rivers, as the Sixers improve to a league-best 6-1 record. It is also worth noting that the Sixers had 34 assists on 46 made field goals- great ball movement shown tonight.  
  
I know that this would be an average game for any star in the league (and it is vs the Hornets), but it's worth noting how consistent Tobias has been, and he's finally proving doubters wrong. Thoughts? Do you think his contract will be looking a little bit better once this season is over?",Tobias Harris with another solid game in another victory versus Charlotte: 22/5 on 10/16 shooting
"This is just a random thought I had and it’s completely true

Despite losing Kawhi and Danny the raptors were still dominant and on pace for a just as good record

Now with the loss of Ibaka and Gasol the Raptors look like a 7th or 8th seed and might just miss the playoffs",Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol leaving had a bigger impact on the Raptors then Kawhi and Danny Green leaving
In MLB defenses tend to shift a specific direction to cut off the highest chance of a batted ball landing in a particular part of the field. How does the NBA defenses shift to slow down Giannis?,How do defenses shift against Giannis?
It’s been a full season since we have seen Brogdon in action - as the starting point guard for Indiana last year he averaged 16/7/4 on 44/31/90 splits. He appears to be the heart of the offense and has been stellar so far this season. Where do you rank him among starting PG’s in the league today?,Where do you rank Malcolm Brogdon among point guards in the league today?
"***Assists Per Game:***  
Jokic: 12.8  
Westbrook: 11.8  
Harden: 11.0  
Trae Young: 8.3  
Chris Paul: 8.3  


The only center to ever finish the season leading in assists was Wilt Chamberlin in 67-68.

EDIT: No center has ever finished the season leading in APG. Apparently Wilt lead the league in total assists that season but Oscar had more APG while only playing a total of 65 games.",A Center is Leading The League in Assists per Game
"In a theoretical expansion draft incumbent teams my withhold 8 players from the draft. On the surface this might seem like an easy question for most teams but there seems to be a lot of debate on the last spots. What do you all think?

For me the Celtics would withhold Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams, Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith

... Right?",Who would your team withhold from an NBA expansion draft?
"Not looking for things easily found on Youtube already - looking for stuff that was aired on TV and someone might have recorded and never uploaded yet - I am talking all the way back to 1993, when he was playing in South Carolina, his time then for Farragut in Chicago, I know for the Draft in 1995 there were programs aired that networks haven't kept. Anything from his early years at the Wolves. Even KG remembers doing an interview on a trampoline for the 1996 draft (he thinks it was for ESPN). 

Thought I might at least try Reddit, who knows!",Anyone have rare Kevin Garnett aka KG Archival Footage? Looking for a new documentary
"For contender teams, which composition is better? Also I’m talking about real max players, not tobias/wiggins type players. If you have 3 max players, you have a higher chance of losing a max player to injuries than if you had 2. And right now the league is as competitive as ever, so losing 1 max player pretty much means GG for contenders.","What’s a better team composition, two max players plus good role players, or three max players plus vet min players?"
"Watching great players team up is fun (for fans of teams that didn’t just lose one of the great players, at least). However, it’s also really fun when two random guys just really click really well together. 



Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell in 2018-19 was what I was thinking of when writing this, with that p&amp;r got us into the playoffs over a team with lebron in “playoff”(aka injured) mode. 

there could be all kinds of those around the league that I missed or that very few people know about. Like what if when all the holiday brothers combine they become unstoppable.",Favorite non-star duos all time
"With the competitive instinct he had as a player he has squandered the Hornets ever since he owned them. Been comfortable sitting around 7th or 8th or just outside the playoffs. The Hornets contracts have been crazy. Overpaying guys like Batum and low balling Kemba. Their coaches are always poor or jmediocre. Whenever they sign ""big names"" it's usually guys way past their prime like Tony Parker or Dwight. Kemba was the only all star they've drafted in last ten years since Jordan has owned the team.

I know Jordan was bitching a few years back when it was Warriors vs Cavs every year in the finals for awhile that the NBA made it to hard on small market teams because of all these other teams scooping up all the big names to create superteams. Maybe it's a lack of money causing him to fail the Hornets? Seems like he should be trying harder than he has because of his ""do anything to win"" mentality from the past.",Why do you think Jordan hasn't been competitive as an owner like he was as a player?
"I know it’s really early in the season but my top 3 surprises are Keldon Johnson, Sabonis, and Christian Wood (Tobi as an honorable mention). I expected all 3 to be good, just not like this. As for disappointments, Oubre (I believe he’ll figure it out), Devonte Graham (Same as Oubre but to a lesser extent) and Mitch Robinson (massive foul trouble/scoring has been an issue this year, still looks great on D). Let me know who you think!",Who has been your biggest surprise and disappointment so far in the season?
As the title says. Not talking about centers defending the post. Who is in your top 5 for 1 on 1 perimeter defense and who is in your top 5 for help defense?,Who are the top 5 1 on 1 perimeter defenders in the league and who are the top 5 help defenders in the league?
"Where do you rank Curry as an ISO scorer, I think he’s just under Harden, KD and maybe Kyrie but where do you rank him? Is he Top 5-10 or even lower?",Curry as a ISO scorer
I know the Raptors suck right now but you can not say he is overpaid. Dude straight up balled out today and was the only reason this was not a 30+ blowout,"Fred Vanvleet today 35 points,7 rebounds,3 assists and 2 steals and shot 65% from the field and 66% from three"

&gt;[After experiencing discomfort during the Raptors’ return to play, it was determined Patrick McCaw should depart the NBA Campus in Orlando to seek treatment for a reoccurrence of a benign mass on the back of his left knee.](https://www.nba.com/raptors/patrick-mccaw-injury-update)


The Raptors went on to lose against Boston in the second round including games where they got blown out by 18 and 22.

Since McCaw wasnt physically in the bubble, the loss shouldnt count towards his championship record.

McCaw has still not return to play and his i jury status is unknown. Is the lack of McCaw's presence broken the Raptors team?",How much has losing Patrick McCaw affected the Raptors?
"It is nice to see that the 76ers aren't blowing leads once Embiid and/or Simmons sit. Maxey has proven to be a smart team player so far this season, and has been a nice backup PG off the bench. With his help tonight, the 76ers improved to a league-best 6-1 with their win over the Hornets.

[Fast break dunk](https://streamable.com/dcwzg2)","76ers rookie Tyrese Maxey vs. the Charlotte Hornets tonight: 11 points (2-3 3FG), 2 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steal, and one serious slam dunk on the fast break."

"In the 3:20 period when Booker sat, the Suns were a whopping -19. Now, for context, the Suns were already down during the moments when Booker sat and most of his +/- is derived from clawing back a 31-point deficit into a close game. But still, this is a mind-blowing little bit of single game +/-. Booker’s usual backups, Langston Galloway and Jevon Carter, were -19 in the 3 minutes they shared the floor.","Against the Clippers last night, Devin Booker was +14 in 44:40 of play time ... the Suns lost by 5."
"These two will be linked throughout their careers.

"Full Quote:

&gt;I felt Montrezl Harrell had a really interesting response to the uptick in his face-up game this season, and how the Lakers' offensive system differs to teams he has played on in the past. Harrell currently is shooting 55% on his midrange attempts, and a career high in frequency.

Trez:

&gt;""Honestly it's just being able to play my game, not being totally set on it's gotta be this, this or this, and it's kinda been the system I have kinda been playing in for awhile. It's gotta be threes layups or free throws. It's not like that over here. They play to their style of everybody's game, and we're not looking at anyone like you got to do this, you got to do that man, we play basketball over here""

&gt;It's a free-flowing game, nobody tries to go outside of themself, and I think that's what the best thing is about being over here on this team and being with these guys because everybody does what they already do well, nobody try to go out there and prove they do something that people haven't seen""

"Curry finished the game with 5 rebounds and 4 assists as well.

It was refreshing to see Steph back in form. His energy is unlike anyone else's in the league that we've ever seen. 

Unfortunately it seems like this is what the Warriors will need every night in order to win a significant number of games.  Wish Klay was healthy to see what they could do together.",Steph Curry scores a career-high 62 points on 18-31 shooting and 8-16 from 3.

"At the time of the trade everyone clowned the Sixers for giving up Fultz and only getting Jonathan Simmons and a “fake first rounder” in return. Flash forward to 2021 and that fake first has turned into Tyrese Maxey. Maxes not only a promising prospect but he has been giving the Sixers meaningful minutes already. His stats have not been overly impressive but he’s looked great as a primary ball handler with the bench unit, can create his own offense and is an active defender. Meanwhile Fultz has become even more inefficient than he was in Philly. He’s also making $20m a year for 4 years while Maxey only makes 3/4.  Sixers won the trade",Did the Sixers win the Fultz trade with Orlando?

Young is averaging 28.2 ppg and 10.7 of those are coming from free throws that he intentionally draws. Steve Nash criticized it saying it was not how you play basketball. He’s obviously not the only one to do this (cough cough Harden) but he seems to have done it the most this season. How can the league prevent players from doing this? Should the NBA call less fouls but increase the potency of a flagrant?,Trae Young’s offensive tactics. How can we prevent this?

"Solid start to the season for Cam. Feels like people forget how highly he was rated coming out of high school. It was the right decision by Atlanta to keep him in a starting role despite their off-season additions. Still only 21-years old as well, he's got a bright future ahead of him.

"Throughout his first 5 games of this season, Griffin did these:

0 Offensive Boards, 0 Blocks, 0 Dunks, 0 And1. He attempted 65% of his shots behind the 3pt line and only 13.3% of his attempts were from 0-3ft area. His average shot distance this season is... 19.1ft. It's almost high as JJ Redick's career number. 

It's painfully clear that his days of an athletic freak is more than just 'gone'. He just strolls through the court like AI after his retirement. Of course, Griffin is still a savvy guy for his size, at least. Decent shooter with some great handles and playmaking ablilities.

One of the most amusing things about watching San Antonio Spurs games to me is watching their coach Gregg Popovich on the sidelines. Somehow, he has not lost his competitive fire at all at age 71 and he remains as spirited as ever toward the refs and his own players. Whenever the cameras cut to him “going Serbian” (in his own words) I’m always curious about what gets him so ticked off. Usually, this is extremely difficult to decipher in the moment. When I watched him fly off the handle late in the 1/5/2021 game between the Spurs and the LA Clippers, I decided to look back at a few plays down the stretch of that game and try to get to the bottom of what had him so angry.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 1

https://streamable.com/mqkme3

In this first clip, Keldon Johnson (no. 3) messes up a switch and doesn’t get to his man (Luke Kennard, no. 5) in time, leading to an open jumper. Although the play does end up in a Clippers turnover after Kennard misses the shot, Pop strikes me more of a process than a results guy and I’m sure defensive execution is something he drills on a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 2

https://streamable.com/rtquxz

The next frustrating breakdown I saw was with about 2:40 left in the 4th, when Lou Williams (no. 23) blows by Johnson for a layup easily with his speed advantage. Demar Derozan (no. 10) is there with the help, but he is a step late and Williams is such a great finisher that there’s not much Derozan can do. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 3

https://streamable.com/npkwyp

The very next play, Johnson and Patty Mills (no. 8) mess up a defensive coverage on the pick and roll and this leads to an open 3 point basket. When Lou Williams sets a ball screen for Kawhi Leonard (no. 2, Johnson’s man), Patty Mills begins guarding Leonard since he thinks the two are supposed to switch the players they are guarding. However, Johnson fights over the screen and stays with Leonard also, leading to Williams popping to the top of the key and nailing the shot. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 4

https://streamable.com/9363l1

The next defensive possession for the Spurs, Patrick Beverley uses a drag screen from Kawhi Leonard to drive the ball to the hoop and pick up a layup. In this play, Johnson stays with the ball handler (Beverley), but floats a little bit too far to the right, giving Beverley an easy lane to the rim. Johnson’s positioning is probably fine in terms of depth, since at this point in the game Beverley had canned SIX 3-pointers and the Spurs might not have wanted Beverley to raise up and shoot the ball as he came off of the screen. However, Johnson should have been able to slow Beverley down enough for help to come. Thus, you notice that he does not drop back to explicitly take away the layup in favor of offering a 3-pointer, but goes up to the level of the screen to run Beverley off of the 3-point line. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Pop reaches the end of his rope

https://streamable.com/5x4h14

I slowed down the clip to try to read Pop’s lips as the camera catches him speaking to the players here. I think he’s saying “HEY! Can you guard somebody?” directed at either Gay, Derozan, or Mills, since Johnson is on the other side of the court.

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/svkuo0


With 5.7 seconds left, Patty Mills had two free throws to ice the game but the Clippers insisted on a replay review instants before Mills was about to shoot his first free throw in an attempt to “ice” him. Basically, the strategy is to make Mills think about the free throw more and psychologically influence him to miss it, a strategy which has been debunked before. When the refs decide to stop and review, you can hear a voice (probably Pop) yelling in the background, “THAT’S BULLS--T”. To be quite honest, Pop is not wrong since I believe the rulebook states that replays must be executed before the foul shooter sets foot on the free throw line. 

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/536dkr


At this point, Pop’s rage knows no bounds and the cameras show his next victim to be Keldon Johnson. I’ve slowed down the clip below, and it appears Pop says, “Oh, is that what you’re saying? Huh? HUH?” possibly dismissing Johnson’s attempts to defend himself. 

&amp;nbsp;

"The Denver Nuggets HAD been the brightest team with the best looking future in the NBA. This season, they are obviously off to a bad start, going 3-5 after losing to the mavericks. I believe that the two main reasons for this are the departure of Jerami Grant, but the horrendous coaching from Michael Malone. 


Malone has beet trying and forcing a 4 guard lineup, ultra small ball. These lineups have not been working at all, only hurting the team. The opposing team almost always goes on long runs against these 4 guard lineups. Also, rebounding has been a massive problem all season. How do we fix this? By putting 4 guards out on the floor, according to Malone. 


Jerami Grant decided to move to Detroit, wanting to become a larger part of the offense. He was an excellent wing defender, along with Torrey Craig, another wing who left the Nuggets. The Nuggets have repeatedly been getting pounded from deep, and it seems like opposing teams go 50% from downtown due to the lack of good wing defense. The front office replaces these players by signing 2 undersized point guards, leaving the team with 5 point guards. That's 1/3 of the entire roster, point guards.


Because of this, I don't see the Nuggets presenting a challenge to any of the top 4 teams in the west, an utter waste of the superstar talent the team has in Jokic, Murray, and Michael Porter Jr. I see the Nuggets landing at 5th or 6th seed unless there is a significant turnaround.",The Denver Nuggets' disappointing start to the season.

"As most people know, the current league protocol is if a player has been in contact with someone who had it, they have to isolate for 7 days at minimum (even if they have had the virus before you can get reinfected but the evidence suggests it isn't very common).

"1. They get drafted to the LA Lakers one year apart as high lottery picks. 

2. They play together on a rebuilding Lakers team, do relatively well but not exactly as good as they were hyped up to be. 

3. Both gotten rid of in replaced with a new more popular player of their position and a somewhat similar play-stye (LeBron and Lonzo) 

4. Both find their way on to a thought to be bad New York team (Nets and Knicks) and out preform and drastically improve as players becoming the surprising new leader of the team. 

5. The team out preforms expectations and 
become the new exciting fun team to watch with a new culture (with the help of new coaches (Kenny and Thibs) 

Only difference is D-Lo gets traded and the Nets acquire starpower from D-Lo (possibly what’s next for Knicks?)",The careers of Julius Randle and D’angelo Russell are eerily similar...

While Jokic isn't the best regular season performer (although this season he may prove us wrong), he always step's his game up in the playoffs. In only his second year, he made it to the conference finals, only losing to the eventual champs. Will Jokic be as good as the players I've listed here? Not super likely. Is he showing potential to be one of the best playoff performers of this era? I think yes.",[OC] Jokic's playoff stats vs HOFer's first 2 years in the playoffs
"“I think he’s going to be an iconic figure … I’m so proud of this guy and so pleased for him … to see his development as a human being, as a citizen, as someone who looks at the social issues of our time and is willing to speak out,” Popovich said about James, via Mike Trudell of Spectrum Sportsnet.”

"Famed point center Bismack Biyombo has started the last seven games due to a Cody Zeller injury, and averaged 3.0 assists per game, after recording zero coming off the bench on opening night. He has recorded 21 assists in these games.

Over this same stretch, Terry Rozier, who was once seen as a point guard for some reason, has recorded 20 assists, 2.9apg.

Felt this was a stat that needed to be known by more people. Do what you like with this information.

"[Article](https://sports.yahoo.com/los-angeles-clippers-all-star-paul-george-mental-health-struggles-nba-190030411.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKYQKkV6MaMHNqVbFeSbfKHkG7z-dq_LKXTrBJKfoMFwYNUKZYm2sWa_5T7xcc3RPYRA8qfs83KIepQGR18V8JgpzsfTkfMRsFbv-7sO0r21keYMElO-2IXPWYTZcjsFEzU0BlfgEZ-nl6Ykww0LmuXn2xP4opuRrsrNS-tfd0uG)

There has to be a question of Paul George's new reputation as 'soft' is due to his openness about mental health, which this article brings up.

Paul George doesn't know where it's coming from: 
&gt; Last year was last year. I'm in a new situation; I am in a different mindset. Any of that hate stuff, you got to ask them. I don't know where that's coming from. 

Ben Rohrbach in the article directly blames this new hate on Paul George's openness about mental health.
&gt; Was George “soft” when he rebuilt himself into an MVP candidate after suffering one of the most brutal leg injuries the game has ever seen in 2014? No. Was he “soft” for taking umbrage when Cameron Payne wildly jumped on that same leg after the whistle was already blown, sparking Booker’s outburst on Sunday? No.

&gt; We all know why Booker said what he said. Except, George is not “soft” for having the courage to share publicly what others in the NBA would not. He is stronger. Mental health struggles are real, especially during the pandemic, and professional athletes are not immune. Paul himself called this his top priority as the National Basketball Players Association president over the summer. His lines on the court might be blurrier.&gt;","[Rohrbach] Paul George is back on top because he shared his mental health struggles, not in spite of them"
"So this is more about fit then anything. You want to build a team that can try to win this season. I’m gonna give you some options, use them to create a 8 man rotation(or just a starting 5 if you’re lazy). Just follow the directions and you’ll get your team.

If you did all of those you should have a total of 8 players. How is the team you just made. Who are your starters and bench guys? Is your team capable of winning a finals in today’s nba?",Follow the guideline to create the best team you can. Why did you pick who you did and how do they fit together?
I know Josh Hart plays warzone. He talks about it quite often on Twitter. Also didn’t bron play football in hs? Just interested to hear this tbh.,Best gamer/multi sports athletes in the NBA?
"I haven't.

One of the minor talking points in the bubble was that players now have a lot more space under the basket and don't have to worry about falling into clunky cameras and tweaking an ankle. I thought I would have noticed the absence of those specific camera angles, but I nearly forgot about them. The main angles they would provide are the baseline angles (used sparingly) and for halftime/post game interviews .

I think we should do away with that angle permanently and have the cameraman needed for interviews sit elsewhere.","Between the bubble and the start of this season, have you noticed the lack of baseline cameramen in terms of the camera angle they provide?"

"Having watching him play at Bentonville, then Kentucky, I feel like he is. I want him to be successful, but damn. 
I have not watched him play in the NBA but I hear he is doing poorly. What do you think?",Is Malik Monk considered a bust?

It seems like there has been a lot less ref complaining so far this season than usual. In seasons past, I swear every post game thread was complaining about the officiating. This season, and maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like I see a lot less of it.","Have the refs gotten better, or are we all just complaining out them less?"
"He also had a block and 3 steals, one of which basically iced the game. He was 7/15 from the floor and 3/7 from 3, with all of this threes coming in the fourth quarter. He did this all without De'Aaron Fox. The dude just plays way beyond his years, and is looking well in the race for ROTY.","Tyrese Haliburton drops 17/7/6 in his first game back from injury, including 15 in the fourth quarter"

|^[boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com](https://boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com/) ^by ^/u/bazman1976 ^(original work by /u/Obi-Wan_Ginobili)|",[Post Game Thread] The Boston Celtics (6-3) defeat the Miami Heat (3-4) 107-105 off the Payton Pritchard putback game winner
"He started the game 0-6 from the field, then went absolutely nuclear. He had two and-ones and a crucial block on Bradley Beal (who was incredible, scoring 60 points) down the stretch.

Embiid's performance was just enough to eke out a 141-136 win, keep the home winning streak alive and propel the Sixers to an NBA-best 7-1.

edit: 38 points, not 37 (that's 63% of a Bradley Beal!)","Joel Embiid: 37 pts on 11-20 FG, 3-4 3PT, 13-13 FT. Also added 8 reb, 5 ast, 3 stl, 3 blk"
"Timberwolves fans told everybody that Jimmy Butler and Thibs were the problem.    

Last year Jimmy proved them wrong by being the guy to lead his team to the finals.    

Now Thibs is proving he is still a great coach.        

Meanwhile the Timberwolves still suck.      

IDK maybe the problem is KAT?",How bad does it look that both Jimmy Butler and Thibs are succeeding after being run out of Minnesota?
"I was bored and decided to look up what he was up to now with the Pistons, and as it turns out he's giving them a solid 15/4 in 20 minutes a night. Pretty good for someone who spent the majority of last season in the G-League with his career looking like it was gonna go by the wayside. 

Is this just another product of good numbers on a bad team, or is Josh Jackson = future all star back on the menu?",Is Josh Jackson's resurgence for real?
"It seems like literally all of the coaches hate doing it and they usually give non-answers anyway, so what’s the point of doing the interviews at all?",What are your opinions on the mid-game coach interviews?
Austin Rivers has hit some clutch shots in the previous 2 games including a dominating performance in the 4th quarter tonight. 3 years/10 million seems like a steal so far.,Austin Rivers in the Knicks win tonight vs the Jazz: 23 pts/3 rebs/2 asts on 9/14 FG (5/7 3pt) including 14 consecutive points for the Knicks late in the 4th
"Here are some guys who I think deserve a little more love, even if none of them are necessarily not liked

George Hill: An extremely steady, calm, two way point guard. I love how he literally never plays outside his comfort zone, seems like a good leader, and appreciate the work he's put into his three point jumper. 

Lowry: When people talk about the ""desire to win"", I think Lowry embodies that as much as one can. Dude is literally always finding some way to impact the game if he has the ball or doesn't. Defensively he's obviously a master charge taker, and sturdy post defender. Offensively you can trust he'll end up doing something valuable with the ball. Whether it's getting to the line, hitting a three, or finding a teammate. He does have the tendency to flop, but overall, such a joy 

Redick/Korver: Just absolute professionals who have put a ridiculous amount of work towards perfecting one skill: Shooting the ball. A shit ton of repetition and practice to become near all star level players despite lacking impressive physical tools. 

Josh Hart: My favorite player by far, the reason being that his entire game is literally effort based. Hart has genuinely below average talent. He's not a skilled ball handler, not super athletic, and doesn't have a good shooting stroke, or high court vision. The only reason at all he's a serviceable player is because he tries really freaking hard on the defensive end, bodying up bigger guys and securing rebounds like few others guards in NBA history. Even then he sometimes gets lost on defense. He basically is an example of how far 100 % effort in NBA games can get you",Under-appreciated players!
Not including the injured players obviously. But there are a few names that come to my mind immediately. What do you think?,What player do you think has regressed the most this season from last? So far anyway

He looked the best he has since the shutdown although Toronto took another L in their schedule. However if Siakam can get his shit together the Raptors might be able to follow suit. Let's see if he can continue the improved performance after his struggles since last year,"Pascal Siakam comes alive despite another loss: 32 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists on 11/21 shooting"
"When Trae Young doesn't get 15+ free throw attempts off BS foul calls, he struggles. His 3pt shot has been off all season (shooting only 33%) and without the FTs to rely on, Young struggled all night as the Hawks lose to the Hornets","Trae Young tonight: 7 points/5 rebounds/3 assists/7 turnovers on 2/9 FG, 0/3 3pt/, 3/3 FT in 35min"
"Since 2011, 40% of first overall picks were named Anthony (including Karl-Anthony). It is quite amazing how one name can be connected to such a coveted draft position. While we are yet to see how all of their careers will turn out, it seems there are some definite perks to having the moniker. In the grand scheme of things it's astounding to think that around 5.5% of all number one picks have been bestowed the same first name. This thought came to me out of the blue, but let me know if y'all have any theories......",Does Being Named Anthony Increase the Chance You're the 1st Overall Pick?

"I was just thinking how all the recent mvps led their team in win shares. And as I was looking through stats I saw Khris Middleton was the Bucks leader. If this kept up, and hypothetically if the bucks went 72-0, Giannis would most likely win MVP, but Middleton would be the leader in win shares. Because popularity etc etc.

"How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?  


**Actual Standings:**  


East:  


1. 76ers
2. Magic
3. Pacers
4. Celtics
5. Knicks
6. Bucks
7. Cavs Nets

West:

1. Suns
2. Lakers
3. Clippers
4. Jazz
5. Pelicans
6. Warriors
7. Kings
8. Blazers

Here was my predictions for the standings before the start of the season (bracket number is where how far that are in reality vs where I predicted them as of January 6th 2020):

**My predictions:**  
East:

1. Nets ( -7)
2. Bucks ( - 4)
3. Celtics ( - 1)
4. Heat ( -7)
5. 76ers ( +3)
6. Raptors ( -7)
7. Wizards ( - 5)
8. Pacers ( +5)

West:

1. Lakers ( -1)
2. Nuggets ( -10)
3. Mavs ( -6)
4. Clippers ( +1)
5. Jazz ( +1)
6. Warriors ( 0)
7. Rockets ( -6)
8. Suns (+7)
9. Blazers - toss up between 8/9 (+1)

1/10th of the season through, most of these picks look horrible.

I made these predictions an hour before the first game of the season. Let me know if you're curious for some of my picks or what your own picks were. For instance, for the Rockets I made the assumption that James Harden wouldn't play for the Rockets again and would be traded for some decent pieces (I was wrong).",How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?
"I suspect I'm over-thinking this, but I dislike the term 'small ball' because playing small is not the point. It's caught on because it rhymes and is relatively easy for people to picture: More small players, fewer big players.  But it's not about being small for smallness's sake, because if a team could play five big, fast, skilled, switchable guys who were all 7 feet tall, then that's what teams would do. A line-up of five Kevin Durants would be amazing. 

The point of what's commonly called 'small ball' can vary, but it's usually some variation or combination of the following:

* speed ball - fast, up-tempo play
* skill (or versatile) ball - multiple ball handlers, playmakers, shooters who can present many offensive looks
* switchable ball - similar to the previous item, but more of a defensive focus on guys who can switch without compromising match-ups

If you could rebrand 'small ball' then what would you call it instead?",What's a more accurate term for 'small ball'?
"The NBA credited Lamelo Ball with a 3 pointer with 2:12 seconds left in the 3rd quarter that was actually hit by Devonte' Graham. Here is the quote from the box score and here's a picture curtesy of a redditor below: [https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9](https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9)

"" **2:12 LaMelo Ball makes 24-foot three point jumper (P.J. Washington assists) 77-64 ""**

This shot can clearly be seen just after the 7:00 mark of the video highlights from the game (posted literally by the NBA): [https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422](https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422)

Devonte' Graham made the shot - NOT Lamelo Ball.

Is the NBA trying to inflate the stats of Lamelo Ball? Or did Vegas do this somehow as the over/under for Graham was set at 11.5 and this shot would have made the over hit?

TL;DR: Graham scored 14 points this game but was only credited with 11 after this 3 was given to Ball instead of him.",Devonte' Graham had his 3 pointer incorrectly credited to Lamelo Ball
"“ Bradley Beal (4) has passed Gilbert Arenas (3) for most 50-point games in Wizards franchise history. Beal has 57 points after 3 quarters.”

"I think the Lakers are in a tier of their own, and the Clippers are in a tier of their own below the Lakers. 

It's impossible to predict if Harden decides to buy in with Houston or if a trade will go through. And I don't have faith in NOLA if Zion doesn't start playing defense and if SVG doesn't figure out how to maximize his players instead of running Ingram hero ball down the stretch.

So other than LA, I think these are the six teams likely to make the Western playoffs. All of them except the Suns have proven they can make the playoffs with their current core and coach. And CP3 has better teammates on the Suns than he did on the Thunder, so with their hot start showing things are working it's hard to think they'll miss the postseason. 

So how do you rank these six Western teams? I'd say Nuggets, Jazz, Suns, Mavericks, Warriors, Blazers.","Rank the following Western playoff teams: Suns, Jazz, Nuggets, Blazers, Mavericks, Warriors."
There shouldn't be a question at all that he is an All-Star this year. Dude has been absolutely on fire and is by far the floor general for the Pacers.,"Malcolm Brogdon career high with 35 points, on 13/25 FG, 4/6 3PT, and 7 assists."
"Year-by-Year Breakdown:

2020: Danny Green, Lakers

2016: Draymond Green, Warriors

Just a crazy piece of trivia made more funny but their similar name structures. These 2 always found their way onto contenders. Go Sixers and Warriors to keep the streak!",There has been a D. Green in every finals matchup since 2013.
What game has been the best game this year? I feel like there hasn't really been a game that stands out from the rest. The best game I can think of was bucks vs celtics but that might just be because I'm a Celtics fan. Wizards vs nets was good too,Best game of the year so far
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html

Nash, Rose and Giannis are the only MVP's to not reach the Finals. I know it is very early for Giannis and he will most likely play in many. I just thought it was interesting that there weren't more MVP's to not play in the Finals. This dates back to 1955.","Derrick Rose, Steve Nash and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the only MVP winners in the history of the NBA to have never played in the NBA Finals"
"$72 million and his minutes have been trending downward with each game. He doesn't even start. Kevin Huerter played 33 minutes off the bench as well. 

Not looking like a great signing so far.

"Hey y'all, pretty hectic day in the US yesterday so it may have been pretty easy to miss what went on in the Association last night, rest assured I have got you covered. Lots lots lots went on in the NBA last night and I really tried to get you guys the scoop here, let's get into it.(Note this is generally tailored for NBA Fantasy players, but still something all NBA fans would enjoy)

&amp;#x200B;

Nightly Notables

&amp;#x200B;

* Markelle Fultz goes down with a torn ACL
   * Extremely devastating new for Fultz and the Magic. Fultz was averaging career highs in nearly all of his stats and this crucially hurts his development as a player. 
   * I can not stress this enough, but if Cole Anthony is available, add him ASAP. He filled in for Fultz and played a career high 32 minutes. Anthony is a very talented rookie and it will be interesting to see how he fares as the lead point guard for his squad

&amp;#x200B;

* Bradley Beal Drops Career High 60 in the L to Embiid's 38
   * Wow were the stars shining in this one, fitting that the game with no defense yesterday featured a team from Washington playing in it. Beal exploded for 57 points in three quarters, but only scored three more the rest of the game as the 76ers took over late and were able to contain him a bit. Beal's final line was 60 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists
   * Embiid on the other side of the court scored 38 points on 11/20 shooting and 13/13 from the stripe to go along with 8 boards and 5 assists. Embiid's Sixers are off to a sizzling hot NBA best 7-1 start and I think it is only fair for the MVP Embiid talks to start brewing up a bit. 
   * Also want to note that Simmons and Westbrook were their usual triple double threat side-kicks with a 17/6/12 line for Simmons and 20/8/12 line for Westbrook. They continue to prove their worth as daily top options at the PG spot.

&amp;#x200B;

* Hayward, Grant, Brogdon, and White all decide to drop career highs too
   * Gordon Hayward looked awesome against the Hawks pouring in 44 points and hitting some tough shots all game long. It is great to really see Hayward fully healthy and really looking aggressive and confident. It will be interesting to see if he can build upon this explosion
   * Jerami Grant has been terrific early on for the Pistons and although they took the L to Giannis and the Bucks, Grant still dropped 31 points and grabbed 10 boards to go along. Grant has really rewarded those who drafted him in their leagues and seems to have the green light to shoot whatever he wants for Detroit. 
   * Malcom Brogdon dropped 35 points on the Rockets on 13/25 from the field and 4/6 from beyond the arc. Brogdon has been playing at a high level this whole season and Warren's injury has elevated his game even further as he is averaging 26.5 PPG since Warren went down. Brogdon is turning into an elite option at PG for fantasy owners and is really stepping up his game this season
   * Coby White looked incredible in the loss vs the Kings, putting up a new career high with 36 points in 39 minutes. White is starting to find some more consistency as the season progresses with his third straight 20+ game, but he probably won't be playing nearly 40 minutes a game when Sato returns to the lineup

&amp;#x200B;

* Most Improved Randle?
   * Julius Randles has been to simply put it incredible to start the new season. He continued his great play with a 30 points, 16 board, 7 assist outing in a come back win vs the Jazz to lead the Knicks to a 5-3 record this early season. Randle has become a nightly triple threat type of player and after being skeptical at first, it really is looking like Randle might actually be a star player in this league 
   * Also want to point out, Thibs is back to being Thibs, nearly all of his starters played 30+ minutes and Randle, Payton, and Robinson all were either close to or over 40 minutes.  Also important to note Rivers has seen back to back 30+ minute games and is solidifying a role in his rotation, while Quickley saw just 5 minutes. Rivers played great last night in the clutch and had 23 points off the bench for NYK. I would not give up on Quickley entirely as the prior game Thibs trusted him down the stretch. Definitely a situation to monitor. I am curious what happens when Burks returns

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Wall Shines again as Harden struggles with his shot 
   * John Wall impresses again with an efficient 28 points on 12/20 shooting to go along with 6 rebounds and 3 assists in 37 minutes. Wall is back to looking like his healthy, speedy, dynamic self that we saw what feels like ages ago in Washington. He is really looking like a legit top option at the point guard position
   * Harden on the other hand ""only"" scored 15 points on 5/14 shooting and 1/5 from three, although he was in his playmaking mode with 12 assists. His past two games he's gone 10/31 from the field and 4/16 from three. Would not be too concerned about Harden obviously as we all know how talented he is, but I think there could be some reason to believe his points might dip from what we are used to due to the talent on this team with Wall+Woods+Cousins. Again would not be worried much with Harden though as he is one of the best scorers of all time and he has had immensive amount of success with talent around him before, but just some quick knee-jerk reaction here and maybe even could be a time to try and buy him low.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Raptors continue to struggle while the Suns continue to impress 
   * Devin Booker lead the Suns in a balanced attack over with 24 points, Deandre Ayton grabbed a double double with 11 and 16, and CP3 dished out 8 assists as the Suns improve to 6-2 on the early season. The addition of Paul has really helped this team continue what they started in Orlando 
   * The Raptors on the other hand took another L and now fall to 1-6 on the season, and especially with the season being shortened 10 games, they need to figure this out soon. Siakam had his best game of the season dropping 32 points to go with 9 rebounds, but still was not enough to take down Phoenix  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Hitters

* Davis Bertans came off the bench but played 32 minutes and ended up starting the 2nd half instead of Avdija who only saw 15 minutes of action. Bertans has seen back to back games of 30+ minutes and is seeming like he is back to startable territory due to his 3pt presence
* Seth Curry caught fire with 28 points shooting 11/14 from the field and 6/7 from three, which included a 5/5 first quarter from beyond the arc
* Early DPOY front-runner in my eyes, Myles Turner was at it again, this time swatting 8 shots against the Rockets 
* Tatum and Brown combine for 48 in Celtics dub over Heat
* Jimmy Butler plays his best game of the season dropping in 26 points in the loss to the C's 
* Zion and BI combine for 53 in the loss to OKC
* Steven Adams records his first career triple double with a 10/11/10 line
* Coby was not the only Bull doing work, LaVine put up 32 points and Carter grabbed a double-double with 11 points and 17 boards
* DeAaron Fox left the game with hamstring tightness and did not return for the 2nd half, his injury will be one to monitor for sure, I personally do not believe it is too serious as he was celebrating the win with his team on the bench and was moving around. 
* Bagley put up his best game of his season with 21 points and 12 boards, while running mate Richaun Holmes added 24 points on 10/11 shooting as well
* PG and Kawhi match each other with 21 a piece in the Clippers win over the Warriors as Steph struggles with his shot only scoring 13 points

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Report

&amp;#x200B;

* Tyrese Haliburton 
   * Haliburton came back after missing his past two games and after not doing much in the game, turned up in the 4th quarter scoring 15 of 17 points, which included some clutch 3s, and finished the game with 7 boards, 6 assists, and 3 steals. Fox went down in the first half with hamstring tightness, which I do not believe to be too serious, but still he missed the remainder of the game and if is forced to miss time, Haliburton is for sure startable in my eyes and a great DFS play
* Lamelo Ball
   * Ball continues to really show out scoring 16 points on 6/12 shooting and snagging 8 boards to go along with 5 assists. The BC Vytautas product has started to come into his own and is looking like a real threat in this league. He only saw 23 minutes of action tonight, but more minutes are bound to be coming this way if he keeps this play up
* Issac Okoro
   * Okoro returned back to the starting lineup after missing the past 5 games for the Cavs and saw 28 minutes if action. He scored 10 points on 4/5 shooting, while he is not the most attractive fantasy player currently, he should be monitored in 9cat leagues due to his efficiency and has a do-it-all type game 
* Saddiq Bey
   * Bey poured in 20 points and grabbed 10 boards for his first career double double in 24 minutes.  Bey has had a solid start to his career in Detroit and is a player that is worth adding, due to him starting and playing around 30 minutes when the Pistons opt to rest Blake 
* Payton Prtichard
   * Pritchard continues to produce early on and especially without Teague in the lineup. Pritchard saw just 20 minutes last night though with Smart returning to the lineup, but scored 6 points including the game winning tip and grabbed 6 boards and had 4 dishes. He struggled with his shot going 3/10 from the field and 0/4 from three, but I would not be too concerned about that for now as his prior game he shot 8/13 from the field and 2/4 from three. Pritchard's season long value is not as promising though because eventually Kemba will be back for this team and Teague will still be there starting too for now 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am Excited to see tonight

* The Balkan Battle
   * Jokic and the Nuggets are taking on Luka and the Mavs in what is sure to be a fun game from the two European studs, won't be suprised if both players end with triple doubles
* Kyrie and the KD-less Nets get to take on Embiid and the sizzling 76ers
   * Two of the top Eastern Conference squads take on each other tonight, but how will the Nets fare with no KD, will they be able to repeat what they did vs Utah

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the Night: Bradley Beal(60 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 20/35 from the field, 38 minutes)

Dud of the Night: Trae Young(7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 2/9 from the field, 35 minutes)

Rook of the Night: Tyrese Haliburton(17 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 7/15 from the field, 34 minutes)

Player to Target: Cole Anthony 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope y'all enjoyed the run-down, see you tomorrow

"There are supposedly talks of NBA expansion and Seattle - if you believe the rumors - is at the top of the list of cities capable/deserving of a team. 

If the NBA was to expand it would likely add 2 teams rather than just the one. 

What other city would be the best fit for a new franchise and why?  

Vegas seems like the obvious answer for a number of reasons. Or do they go international and look at returning to Vancouver or opening shop in Mexico City? Perhaps the Cincinnati/Louisville/Lexington? Reward the heartland with another team in either St. Louis or KC? California seemingly has enough teams and they were indifferent toward the Chargers, but San Diego is the largest city in America without an NBA team.",Along with Seattle - what other city would be the best for an NBA expansion team?
"i was watching the game last night and noticed something interesting.. they had Dennis/Wes/Kuzma/Bron/AD out there.. going to run a high pnr with Bron/AD as they normally do at the end of games, so seeing the lineup my guess was okay.. it's going to be 5 out, spread pnr 

then i saw AD point to Dennis to stand in the dunker spot.. which was interesting.. https://i.imgur.com/U3Y5GW2.png

AD then sets the screen for LeBron, and as LeBron gets inside the three point line, Dennis runs to the three https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png

AD dunking the ball while Dennis is at the three https://i.imgur.com/YHr8m0k.png

reasons for doing this 

typically, a smaller player would be on Dennis, so when they come to help AD can just finish over them 

secondly, https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png looking at this picture, Brandon Clarke is the help guy now who was guarding Dennis, so Tyus has to be the in between guy focusing on Dennis running to the three and Wes in the corner, that's a pretty routine pass for AD if he chooses to do that 

just something i found interesting, don't typically see a 5 out pnr ran like this",Lakers run a LeBron/AD pnr with a wrinkle

"The goal here is to try to make the best 15 man expansion team off non-protected players.

Rules:

1) Assume its the 2021 offseason and we're having an expansion draft

2) Post 8 players/rights from your favorite team that you would like to protect as a parent comment. To make it more interesting, this includes restricted/bird/non-bird salary rights. For example, the Hawks can use a keeper on John Collins' restricted rights this offseason instead of an 8th actual player considering Collins is going to be an FA and not under contract with the Hawks this offseason.

3) I'll reply in the comment thread on who I'm plucking your team (only 1 player per team.) I can choose a player's restricted rights instead if you do not choose to protect them. 

4) Obviously since there are more teams than roster spots, I can choose to pass on picking from your team",League Expansion Game
"Ben Simmons and Draymond Green are two of my favorite players to watch and I think both have similar, but unique skillsets that I thought would be fun to compare, and I’m curious which player would be more valuable to your favorite team? 

Ben obviously is not close to Draymond in terms of legacy right now. Dray has proven to be a ‘16 game player’ and a champion. Ben has been co-leader of a winning team each year of his career  but hasn’t got past the 2nd round in the 2 playoff runs he played.

That being said In terms of skills I think they’re both great in transition. Ben is faster but I think a little more turnover prone than Dray. They both focus on finding shooters and Draymond clearly knows how to get Steph and Klay open. (For example look at the last shot Steph got for 62!)

In the half court they have different roles. Draymond is a more willing shooter and roller and Ben is a better at driving off the dribble and a bit better at better at passing imo.

And on defense they’re both great but in different ways. Draymond will anchor and coach a defense as well as anyone in the league and he’s so smart at reading pick and rolls and knowing players offensive habits so he can stifle them.

Ben on the other hand will defend the hell out of your best scorer and could very well be the best  1v1 defender in the league, while leading the league in steals last year, but he won’t be a rim protector. 

Who would you add to your team right now? I’d imagine the choice will differ depending on the team.",Simmons and Draymond side by side

How likely is this? What would you expect from an interview/conversation between them? What would you want them to talk about specifically? I'd be interested to hear them discuss anything about basketball and their careers.,Many years from now do you think there will ever be a 1-on-1 interview between Michael Jordan and Lebron James?
Money wise I know it would be a plus but I mean in terms of viewership. We would have 2 more teams which will probably suck for the first few years and it would add to the already abundance of not so good teams. A lot of the teams in the nba aren’t that good and adding more would just spread out the talent more and worsen the situation.,Would an expansion team be better Orr worse for the NBA?

"As a Knicks fan, I am used to my team being projected to lose. They have not been the Vegas favorite to win in a single game this season. I pulled up the over/unders for the season to compare Vegas predictions to actual game outcomes and the Knicks have been the most underrated team of this young season. This figure shows the difference between actual and Vegas-predicted victories (teams that have beaten their odds plot higher on the y-axis):

[Actual vs predicted wins for 2020-2021 season](https://imgur.com/6nfIeWo)

I was curious how these trends stacked up against the last several years, so I pulled in data from the 2014-2019 seasons for comparison. The solid lines show a 1:1 trend (i.e., if Vegas predictions were perfect) and the dotted lines show the actual trends for each season. Lower slopes for the actual trendlines indicate that Vegas' predictions favored the high-win teams too frequently.

[Actual vs predicted wins from 2014-2019](https://imgur.com/rkQlbL4)

On average, Vegas predicts teams that finish &gt;0.500 will win 9% more frequently than they do, while &lt;0.500 teams are picked to lose 23% more frequently than they do.

"The most impressive thing about the Knicks on their hot start is that this team is dead last in 3PA and 27th in 3P. They are winning with barely any 3s at all.

Context: 
&gt;Appearing on the All Things Covered podcast last Wednesday, Shaq was hardly covert when insulting Gobert who signed a $205 million contract extension with the Utah Jazz, saying “I’m not gonna hate, but this should be an inspiration to all the little kids out there. You average 11 points in the NBA, you can get $200 million,”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The former Los Angeles Lakers center also mocked Gobert, a player for the Utah Jazz, posting a photoshopped photo of him dunking on Gobert with the caption: “I would had 45 pts 16 rebound ten missed free throws in three quarters. He woulda had 11 pts four rebounds and fouled out in 3 quarters. I’m a G ”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Rudy responded on IG with: “I guess we’ll never know” and then continued on Twitter: “There is no beef. If people wanna keep speaking negatively about me or keep discrediting what I do it’s on them and all that does is show who they are. I will always be happy for a brother beating the odds. And I’m gonna keep beating the odds.”

"Looking at the Wolves vs Blazers game right now, Blazers up 77-59, and Dame has scored team high 26pts with good efficiency.

"It’s wayyy too soon to make any declarative statements here, but this draft class has a number of players that have impressed already. 

Oh before I go further, if you just want to hear the question and respond:

tl;dr, How normal is this for young players in their first 10 games? Has this draft already exceeded expectations? How have the rookies this year looked in comparison to previous years? Better or worse?


Wiseman and Edwards have both impressed, lamelo has been promising (although he has some cold streaks), Devin Vassell has been a rookie that pop believes in enough to play, Pat Williams has been impressive in Chicago, and, of course, Haliburton has been incredible. 

I don’t think this proves necessarily that everyone was sleeping on the draft class saying “no one is worth trading up for.” I’m really not sure how many rookies over perform in their first few games. I am a stupid man so I can’t remember what the normal amount of impressive rookies is. However, there’s a lot of guys to be excited about. Hope we see more promise as we get further(think when Killian Hayes, obi toppin, and Isaac okoro have shown flashes as well, okoro is looking like a guy who could play for a long time). Also think both quickley and tyrese maxey have all the makings of a guys who could develop into solid contributors  for any team  long term. 

Bonus: too soon guess at all rookie first team!

"It would probably be a cheap trade too. Most likely a second round pick and  another 2nd round pick swap (where NY gets the better of the 2)for Dennis and it’s a low risk high reward thing.

Knicks have 4 point guards on the team (Payton, IQ, Frank, DSJ) and 2 others who can play spot minutes at the point (Rivers, Burks) so there’s not much loss for them their.

&gt;Ibaka wanted to stay with the Raptors and even coming off a career-year, the veteran understood that it might mean having to settle for a one-year deal as the club was doing everything in their power to avoid taking on commitments that would interfere with their cap space in 2021.

&gt;But the Raptors’ first offer – about $12 million for the 2020-21 season – was below what he was expecting and while Toronto came up to $14 million, they were still trying to keep some powder dry to pursue Gasol. That didn’t go over well with Ibaka who, according to multiple sources, resented having to play behind the Spanish international and wasn’t going to sign on for a shared role again. Ibaka quickly pivoted to the Los Angeles Clippers and their two-year deal for $19 million.

&gt;In retrospect, the Raptors absolutely could have kept Ibaka without being a tax team or otherwise altering their off-season plans now or in the future.

Reading this little tidbit from the article, it looks like the Raptors gave Serge a lower offer than he had expected at first, a one year $12 million dollar deal. Then they brought it up to $14 million, but also wanted to keep their options open to retain Marc Gasol as well. Apparently, this was a reason Ibaka decided to go to LA because he didn't want to share a role with Gasol. Serge now gets what he wants, starting for the Clippers. The Raptors end up losing both.

What are your thoughts? Did Serge seem unhappy about his minutes last season?","[Grange] Raptors offered Ibaka 12m/1y, then upped it to 14m/1y but Serge didn't want to share role with Gasol"

"Dude has been a godsend as a coach. He's been managing to get guys who suck bootyhole at defense play good defense. DSJ was playing great defense before injury, Kevin Knox went from playing garbage defense to around average, Bullock went from average to above average. 

On top of that his rotations have been solid. He's put in the right guys at the right moments to secure the win. Also with his rotation, the Knicks have had 6-7 guys injured for almost all their games, and he's able to have the team play hard with only an 7-8 man rotation on these nights.

"Couple years ago, many would say players are playing at their best when they’re 27-28 years old. Fast forward to today, we still have plenty of players performing extremely well in their 30s


Just a small sample, there are plenty more: 
Hayward (30 years old): Just dropped a new career high. Currently averaging the same numbers, at a higher efficiency that he put up during his all star season. 

Paul George (30 years old): Currently having second best season in terms of points per game, career high in assists.

LBJ (36 years old): Pretty self explanatory 

James Harden (31 years old): 29.4 ppg, second best season in terms of assists per game. 

KD (32 years old): 28 ppg, career high in three point percentage 

Curry (32 years old): Just dropped a new career high, 30 ppg.

"Ever since I've been an NBA fan, the West was a conference that had absolute powerhouse teams. I've always found the 2007-2008 season very interesting for the very reason. I don't want this to come off as an insult to the East teams now, cause I think now the East is in a very interesting spot w/ loads of young talent doing well for their teams &amp; who have a lot of good seasons in the future. The west was fully loaded &amp; if you wanted to make the playoffs that year in the west, you HAD to play your heart out every single game.

The Southwest division had 4, FOUR, 50+ win teams. No division in the East had more than 2, &amp; only 3 East teams had more than 50 wins.

No West team secured a playoff spot until April 4, 2008.

The Rockets &amp; Suns had the same record, 55-27, though Rockets were placed a seed higher. The Rockets were 5th seed &amp; Suns were 6th.

Utah had the 4 seed despite Phoenix &amp; Houston having a better record, b/c Utah won their division. This meant 3 games seperated the 6th seed &amp; the 1st seed.

If the playoffs were just an 8 team tournament featuring the highest Win%, Boston, 66-16, &amp; Detroit, 59-23, would have the top 2. The other 6 spots would all be West teams.

The 38-44 Sacramento Kings, had they played in the East, would've made the 8th seed. On top of that, Golden State missed the playoffs by 2 games. If they were in the East, they'd have the 4 seed.

At the time, Golden State had the highest win% for a non-playoff team since the 8 team playoff format. This was tied by the 2013-2014 Phoenix Suns.

Every Playoff team in the West had at least 50 wins.

Finally, despite all of this, Boston beat Los Angeles for the NBA Championship.

Is there any other season that showed how lop-sided talent &amp; competition was than 07-08?",Has any season shown more of a talent &amp; competition gap than the 2007-2008 season?

"After watching Wizards let Embiid score 10 straight when the game was tied with 3 mins left, I was dumbfounded to see lineup:

ish Russ Beal Bertans and Bryant.

Clearly it is BBQ Chicken for Embiid. I was not surprised that Sixers dominated the rest of the game w 4/5 players half the size of Embiid and Simmons.

I get why Brooks left the team on the floor. It's the lineup that led the comeback. But that's the thing. They needed offensive fire power for any come back.

But with 3 mins left, 10 possessions left at most, you gotta play defensive players. It's a more conservative strategy to try to prevent the offense scoring in last 10. Take it possession by possession.

Embiid is the best center in the league. But the Wizards made it easy for him to score. They should have put in Lopez for Bertans and potentially do offense and defense rotations.","In a close game in the 4th, less than 5 points either way, it's more important to make stops with limited possessions left"

"New Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith joins The Woj Pod to discuss transforming his fandom into buying franchise, arriving along with Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert extension talks, leveraging NBA platform for social equality and charity and translating success of his tech empire into Jazz culture.

You can listen to, or download, their conversation on this link: https://traffic.megaphone.fm/ESP6909522314.mp3","Utah Jazz's owner, Ryan Smith, was a guest on ""The Woj Pod"""
"If Doc sends Austin a message tonight saying ""good game son"" is that legally tampering? If he tweets it will he get fined? What if he said something like ""wow good shooting wish some of my guys in Philly had that kinda hot hand!"" Is that stepping over the line? Seriously guys just looking for answers thanks",Tampering question
"Allen was definitely the best center in tonight's game, even though he was matched up against 2x DPOY and $200mil contract star center Rudy Gobert. He was spectacular both offensively and defensively, holding the Jazz to only 21/50 (41%) shooting from inside the 3pt arc, adding 3 steals and 2 blocks, all while only having 1 personal foul. The Jazz didn't lead once for the entire game and the Nets easily blew them out by 34, even without KD.
  
On the other side, Gobert had 10 points and 11 rebounds on 3/10 shooting. Tough nights happen, but it was very impressive how Allen was able to outperform a star center on both ends of the floor. He has a bright future.  
  
EDIT: Allen also had a mean poster right over Rudy, and both of his blocks came against Gobert himself at the rim.","Jarrett Allen matched up against 2x DPOY Rudy Gobert: 19 points, 18 rebounds on 8/9 shooting"
"From Seth Partnow's [recent Athletic Article](https://theathletic.com/2298827/2021/01/05/stephen-curry-points-warriors-joel-embiid-ben-simmons-collin-sexton-cavs/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=curry):

&gt;Prior to Sunday’s career-high 62-point explosion, “What’s wrong with Steph?” seemed like a much more live topic. He seems to quite dispositively have answered the question on his own in the two games since.
&gt;
&gt;That said, it might still be worth a reminder that even for the best players, bad streaks happen. A “bad streak” for Curry saw him open the season with a True Shooting Percentage of “only” 58.3 — still well above league average — on a gargantuan 32.2 usage rate. However, he had made only 18-of-56 3-pointers. Everybody panic!
&gt;
&gt;Except, such a string of rough shooting is … entirely normal. Throughout his career, Curry has had stretches of five consecutive games during which his total 3-point accuracy was 32.1 percent (his mark through five games this season) 48 times, or roughly once every 13 games. In other words, once a month.
&gt;
&gt;It just so happens that because his latest string came in the first five games of a season in which the Warriors’ find themselves bereft of talent — Kelly Oubre’s Golden State career could hardly have started worse, with two good performance lifting his season-long PER from 2.0 to a still unsightly 7.7 — after a long layoff, we were primed for a weekend of overreacting.

So, if you're worried about a player's shooting percentages this early, give them another month or so. It's early in the season.","[Partnow] Even for the best players, bad streaks happen...

Another impressive performance by Jokic despite going into foul trouble early and missing some easy shots. Nuggets improve to 3-4 and Jokic's MVP run has started.,Jokic drops 35/15/6 on 12/20 shooting with 1/1 from 3. Also adds 3 steals and a block.
"There is literally 3-4 guys that could go #1 who are all super prospects.

- Suggs
- Kuminga
- Cunningham 
- Green
- Mobley",Is this the most loaded draft class since 2003?
Wasn’t following basketball ball at the time. Hopefully you guys can provide some insight on this. Context was this question is whether or not Wade or Durant was the #3 behind Lebron and Kobe.,Was Kevin Durant a top 3 player in the NBA from ‘09-‘11?
"I'll preface this by saying I don't get to watch the Sixers much and so don't really know the ins and outs of their game, but I see the take a lot that Simmons and Embiid don't really fit together. We've seen oversized point guard and center duos be successful before like Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq. I know Simmons sucks at shooting, but if they were surrounded by shooters and strong defenders/role players I feel like it could work. Why is there such a lack of faith in their pairing long term?

Edit: I dont mean to imply at all that they are as good as those other duos. Just asking why stylistically it doesnt seem like many people think their games could work together when we've seen similar skill sets matched together before.","If Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq worked, Why Not Embiid and Simmons?"
"With averages of 24.1 Points, 11.7 Rebounds and 11.9 Assists, Jokic has established himself as a prime MVP candidate despite the Nuggets' lackluster 3-4 start. He leads the league in BPM (and VORP) and is second in PER at 31.1 (trailing only  at 31.6).

Despite all this, Jokic boasts a usage rate of only 26.8%, which is the 34th highest in the league. For comparison,  leads the league at 37.3%. This is even stranger when we consider the fact that a traditional big man like Drummond has a usage rate of 29.4%, which ranks 20th in the NBA.

This came as a big surprise to me, as Jokic seemingly affects everything on offense when he's on the court. 

Jokic also has a TS% of 70%, which is 9th in the league

Interesting side note: Jokic also has the the 6th best defensive BPM of 2.5, which is just below . This definitely over rates his defense but perhaps shows he's not a regular season liability on that end.

[Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html)","Despite leading the league in Assists, Assist % and BPM, and being second in PER, Nikola Jokic only has the 34th highest usage rate in the NBA (26.8%)"
"What players do you think would have benefitted the most from playing in a different era because of the style of the game (not the level of competition)? There are so many players of past generations whose talents could have been maximized in another era.

I always think of a guy like Steve Nash whose production skyrocketed after the hand-check rule was made. The current era would fit him perfectly as a floor-spacing, sharpshooting floor general. 

Conversely, I think Kyrie would have feasted in the early-mid 2000s as an ISO scorer with great playmaking abilities.

What do you think?","Who are the ultimate ""played in the wrong generation"" players?"
"People always talk about how Steph Curry is the greatest 3 point shooter of all time, but what about from the midrange and close to the basket? Percentage is part of it, but there is more to it, like who is guarding, when someone makes a shot, like game winners, and whatever else.
Some candidates I immediately thought of.

Midrange: Michael Jordan and Kawhi Leonard

Close: Shaq and Kareem

Those are just random guesses though. Who do you think is the goat at different ranges. Also feel free to discuss from 3 if you think it is not Steph, or who is goat from any other ranges.",Goat from different ranges
I’m wondering if the performance of some players is being affected by the absence of fans.     Are players who normally feed off the crowds energy (like Harden) playing worse? Are mentally weaker players (like Luwawu-Cabarrot) making more clutch shots because they’re not rattled by the crowd?,"Do you think some players are playing better/worse because there are no fans? If so, which players?"
"There was a debate floating around the internet today ranking SG’s in their prime between Tracy Mcgardy, Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade and James Harden. me personally i chose T-Mac, Wade, A.I. then Harden.",prime shooting guards

1. Pound for Pound= Size and Weight: In order to make these calculation we will be factoring in players weight and height
2. Era will be considered so all points will be adjusted to per 100 possessions

"Last Nights NBA Recap, Jan 5th

Hey yall, Im a bit new here, but I am going to start posting these nightly recaps for you guys. Lmk what you guys think! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Nightly Notables

&amp;#x200B;

* Donovan Mitchell and D'Angelo Russell each top 30 points for the first time this season
   * A solid outing for Mitchell in a game in which Utah should have one vs the Nets with no KD
   * Interesting early stat: Mitchell PPG in wins 19.7 PPG, in losses 25.0 PPG
   * Russell had his most aggressive game getting to the line 10 times, doubling his season total attempts from the stripe
   * Encouraging to see that performance from DLo for the Twolves

&amp;#x200B;

* Jarrett Allen monster double double in first start of season
   * Nash opted to start Allen over DJ and it worked out great for the Nets with Allen scoring 19 points and grabbing 18 boards over Gobert and the Jazz
   * It will interesting to see how Nash approaches the center position going forward, but this is great looks for Allen owners 

&amp;#x200B;

* Kyle Kuzma and THT are the ones benefiting from KCP injury
   * Interestingly the Lakers have been starting Kuzma in place of KCP's injury and he has seen 30 minutes in each of his last two games
   * Talen Horton-Tucker has seen 20+ in each of these past two games with no KCP as well
   * Both have not done much with these opportunities, but are both options that would not be horrible value plays on DFS if KCP is still out

&amp;#x200B;

* Juancho Explosion
   * Juancho Hernangomez unloaded on his former team with 25 points, shooting 10/14 and 5/8 from three 
   * There is just no way he can keep that play up, but it was fun to watch him catch fire against his old teammates
   * Another old teammate on Denver that got some extended run was Jarred Vanderbilt, the high-motor player saw 23 minutes of the bench and scored 11 points along with 5 boards. Vanderbilt is a great rebounder, so it will be interesting to see if he gets more time as the season continues, Naz Reid only saw 10 minutes as Minn opted to play a little bit smaller

&amp;#x200B;

* Paul George sits out, Kawhi shows out
   * PG was out, so we got a look on how this Clips team will operate without one of there main studs
   * Kawhi had a season high 30 points on shooting 13/22 from the field in 37 minutes, a big bounce back game from Phoenix where he shot 4/21. Leonard also racked up 10 assists which was also a season high, interestingly he is averaging 6.5 APG which would be a career high 
   * Kennard and Batum both topped 35 min with PG's absence as well. Batum scored 21 points which is his season high, but Kennard struggled from the field shooting 3/10

&amp;#x200B;

* Suite Life of Zach and Coby
   * LaVine and Coby combined for 39 points and 80 minutes in last night's comeback dub over the Blazers. Honestly, modest numbers in a sense that either one of these two could explode for 30,40+ on a given night, but these two are going to see a lot of action during this Western conference trip. Sato is out with Covid rules so Coby is seeing all the run at PG and if the Bulls want to stay in games, LaVine needs to be on the court. It will be interesting to see if the Bulls could ride the momentum they have started to brew on this trip out west. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Watch:

Anthony Edwards: Played 25 minutes against the Nuggets which has been pretty on par with is playtime throughout the season, he hoisted up 19 shots, but went 1/7 from three. His 28% from the three is not exactly what you want to see early, but that was his 7th game of his career and he seems like he has the confidence and ability to improve that. Regardless when he is on the floor he is the focal point, his 25.8 usage% is first for rookies playing over 10 min a game, but Melo Ball is very close behind at 25.5%

&amp;#x200B;

Facundo Campazzo: Lol is this guy really counting as a rookie, Facu has started to come into his own these past two games for Denver. He's seen 20+ minutes in each of those games and had double digit outing in each of those games. He only had two assists  in each of those games, but this man is a natural born playmaker, and if Malone keeps giving him minutes, those numbers are bound to rise

&amp;#x200B;

Desmond Bane: Saw 20+ minutes for the 6th time in 7 games although only scoring 7 points , encouragingly in his past 6 games he has shot at least 4 threes a game and is shooting 47% from three on the season. 

&amp;#x200B;

Devin Vassell: Only played 16 minutes last night, but the shooting was on display going 3/4 from three with 12 points. Vassell is playing behind some good talent in SA, but if he is shooting 54%(obviously cannot sustain this but impressive start) from three right now, more minutes should be eventually coming to him. He has also racked up 5 steals over his past three games. The 3&amp;D player he was advertised of at FSU is starting to show it in the league. 

&amp;#x200B;

Patrick Williams: Williams scored 14 points in 24 minutes in Chicago's come back dub. Williams is continuously showing flashes of his high potential. He really won't be the focal point of this offense at all this season, but he is a little bit of everything type of player and is shooting the ball well making him an attractive 9 cat piece.

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the night: Nikola Jokic(35 Pts, 15 Rebs, 6 Asts, 12/20 shooting)

Dud of the night: Demar DeRozan(6 Pts, 5 Rebs, 6 Asts, 3/9 shooting)

Rook of the Night: Devin Vassell(12 Pts, 2 Rebs, 1 Stl, 4/5 Shooting, 16 mins)

Player to target: Facundo Campazzo

An anonymous scout calls the Miami Heat’s 2020 playoff run a 'situational overachievement'

""They were not that good. Butler played out of his mind, Herro played out of his mind, they were all kumbaya, but they were not quite that good.""

(Via ESPN)

As a die hard Heat fan, it erks my brain to see the blatant disrespect we have been receiving from NBA twitter over the last couple of weeks. 

We pulled off an improbable finals run by beating the team with the best record in the NBA, most PPG in the league, as well as the the best DEF rating in the league. Notice how I said TEAM and could care less about the 2x B2B MVP they have as well. 

On top of that we beat a Celtics team that has gone to the ECF the last 3 out of 4 years with Jaylen, Tatum AND a brand new addition in Kemba Walker. 

I understand the “bubble” adds a certain X-factor to the equation that we can’t physically see in terms of data but when are people going to accept that our squad was and is actually great? 

I’ve never been more excited about the future of our team in terms of young talent with a core such as ours ESPECIALLY with the coaching talent we have to groom them. 

I’ve be on vacation from NBA Reddit for quite a bit so I’m not sure what the current consensus is on us, but let me tell you NBA Twitter is a bunch of casuals. It’s time I come back home lol.

The question I have for you all is, what makes everyone think we can’t do the same thing again?",[NBA CENTRAL] An anonymous scout calls the Miami Heat’s 2020 finals run a “situational overachievement”
"This doesn't have to be a massive bust or even a high profile guy, for me it'd probably be Frank Ntilikina. I was so sure that guy was gonna work. But no one is perfect at evaluating talent, so who are your big misses when it comes to cant miss prospects?","Who was your ""cant miss prospect"" who turned out to not live up to your hype?"

"So in football there’s a kicker to take all your kicks, which are kinda of like free throws. Ofcourse no fouls lead to the kick, but nonetheless there are designated positions for that.

What if players like JJ redick or Jose Calderon could be signed for the sole purpose of making fts.

The points should still count for the player who took the beating in the first place because I know James Harden won’t be happy if 10 points get take away from his 34 ppg. 

The FT shooters themselves can be judged on FT’s made and FT’s attempted, no need for points. 

There is also the chance for increased foulbaiting because it’s more assured points, but to change that, what if these FT positions for every 4th foul your worst free throw shooter takes two. Therefore you’ll want to avoid, especially in the 4th quarte, the chance of your worst free throw shooter taking the game winning FT’s.

Dumb idea, but also pretty creative imo",What if teams could sign FT positions?
"Hi everyone, if this has been brought up before, this can be taken down. I was thinking a little bit this morning on what Adam Silver mentioned the other day about expansion and what would be needed to expand the league. But my question to you all is this...

Could a group of fans ( for Seattle or Las Vegas or some other city) create an investment group of fans like the Green Bay Packers have and make it work in the NBA? 

The idea would be the fans own the team, most likely a shareholders group run the team, but ultimately the team would be owned by the fans. Could this be done in today’s era, and what would be needed to make this happen besides money? 

While this might be a silly idea, I am curious to know honest and open ideas and how to make it work.",Fan owned team in the NBA?
"I think that the NBA has a lot of good choices for expansion and I'll put it in a list.

1.) Bring in Seattle and St. Louis/Kansas City

They should have never gotten rid of Seattle and no other teams are in Missouri.

2.) Bring Seattle and Vancouver and move Pelicans or Grizzlies to the east.

This is logical because Memphis and Louisiana are both in the east and west kind of and you could move either/or. Adding Vancouver could be a good way to bring the NBA more international.",IDK where to post this but I'll put this here and if it gets taken down so be it.
"There are many arguments on here like “KD is the most skilled player” or “Giannis is not skilled enough from a talent standpoint, his success is all predicated on athleticism.”

Has the word “skill” become synonymous with shooting? Think of the most skilled players in the NBA in your opinion. Almost all of them are good shooters, and for good reason as shooting is an important list.

Now ofcourse there are multiple more skilled players than Giannis, but to group him, Ben Simmons, and Westbrook into this “all athleticism minimal skill” seems wrong, no?

Like Giannis may not be the upper echelon of skilled *players*, but for *big men* he might just be.

Better passer than everyone except Jokic. Sabonis and Bam are arguable. Elite defensive IQ. His handles are probably the best in the game for a pf. Has numerous types of finishes, etc.

All of this applies to Ben Simmons too.

Is shooting too reflective of “skills” now?",Has “skilled” become synonymous with good shooter?
"He's looked pretty rough offensively these few games. He's currently averaging 8.5 ppg on 30% fg. He was real solid last year offensively too, He was putting up 16ppg on 40% from three on 5 attempts a game and had a 50% fg. Hoping he can turn it around soon, he's a super solid player.",What has happened to Norman Powell?

Yet he's left-handed in writing. He's naturally born as a lefty but trained himself to be right handed. How come? Wouldn't he dominate even more if he was left handed? I mean look at the MLB. Some stars like Barry Bonds or CC Sabathia are natural righties but play left handed and have been stars that way.,Why is Lebron right handed in basketball?
"My father and I, both avid basketball fans, have an ongoing discussion about starting 5 in a playoff series. Just looking for opinions on who should’ve been chosen over our list.

Me
PG- Curry
SG- Kobe 
SF- Lebron 
PF- Rodman
C- Yao Ming
6- Karl Malone

Dad
PG- MJ
SG- Harden
SF- Bird
PF- Barkley
C- Shaq 
6- Nowitzki

Who would you choose and why? We’ll give our own reasoning on the matchups in the comments

P.S Drinking has been involved in this list so pls take that into account lol. Also we chose to discredit injuries and such. 

Edit- we couldn’t choose the same players, this is all about matchups, we also chose a 6th man over a substitute",Starting 5 in playoff series (All Time)
Title. I liked him as a player and he's a cool guy also. I even bought a red shirt inspired by when he was on GQ. But in Orlando and even more so now his stats look rough out there. I haven't seen many Raptors games after Kawhi and JV (I'm Lithuanian lol) left and that's why I'm asking :),What's up with Siakam?

"This is probably something that is probably best answered by “just start watching” but I want to shoot anyway. I am new to watching sports. I love playing them, but never really was a big spectator. I recently started watching NBA and I have really enjoyed learning about the individual teams. The problem is, the NBA is so BIG. It’s hard to follow all the trades, wins/losses, who is healthy etc. I want to follow a team (the closest one for me would be the Grizzlies), but I still want to understand the many different things that happen outside of one franchise. How do you do it?",How did you get into watching the NBA?
"Who are your new sleepers for the playoffs? Is a certain hyped up player really just a washed bum riding a high? Who is looking like a legit 6MOY? Should Christian Wood's nickname be ""The Cross""? Are the Raptors making the playoffs? Will Julius Randle's legs survive Thibs? Is Jokic your regular season MVP or Finals MVP? Will the All-Star celebrity game be played on 2K? Go off nephews.","A few games into the season, what are your new hot takes?"
"They had Gobert there thrice getting his ass handed to him but not the dagger from Zach. 

Even I didn't notice it until I read the comments from some angry Bulls fans. Has this been a common theme? 

You can watch the video here:  [Top 10 plays of the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkE1UufhFx4)",The NBA top 10 plays on their YouTube channel didn't feature Zach Lavine's dagger.
"
Any player surprised you being (or not being) on the list? Anyone surprisingly high or low? Which U-25 players have a chance to reach top50 in the future?

"It's a short sample size, but do you think Harrell was a good addition to the Lakers? I personally don't see how adding a huge defensive liability at the forward/center position can be considered a solid addition for a defense first team, even if he has scoring punch. 

The Lakers' defense in general just looks mediocre

What do you think?",Was Montrezl Harrell a good acquisition for the Lakers?
"Today I am going to discuss 25 players who are improving dramatically and whose stocks are rising.

**() Overall Rank**

**1 Jaylen Brown (25)**

I expected Brown to be solid but nobody expected this. Just 8 games into this season he has cracked my top 25 for the 1st time in his career while averaging over 26 PPG on over 57% shooting. Kendrick Perkins has been a huge supporter, going as far to say that he is better than Jayson Tatum. That's overboard but at this rate he is a shoe-in for his 1st all-star appearence.

**2 CJ McCollum (28)**

McCollum has always been considered one of the better 2nd options in the league, but he has taken his game to the next level so far. His solid play has already put him in serious consideration for his 1st all-star appearance with over 27 PPG on over 43% shooting from 3 while shooting a ridiculous near 12 3's a game. It is yet to be seen whether he can keep up this insane production throughout a whole season and I have my doubts but if he were to continue at this rate we could potentially be talking even all-NBA level.

**3 Tobias Harris (32)**

Harris has been one of the most efficient scorers in the league for one of the best teams in the NBA. Rivers has given major praise to Doc Rivers so far and the coaching change seems to have done wonders for his game. Shooting over 47% from 3 with a career-best 22.6 PER so far, Harris is inching closer to equaling the value of his max contract right now at least.

**4 Malcolm Brogdon (38)**

Brogdon is probably the most under-the-radar player on this sub right now. He has established himself as one of the best point guards in the East (I currently have him 4th) and has great efficiency while having a career-best year in terms of advanced defensive statistics. He's also shown a knack for clutch plays, hitting a game winner against New Orleans.

**5 Collin Sexton (41)**

Dwyane Wade gave praise to him yesterday, and Sexton is quickly establishing himself as a potential consistent all-star talent starting in 2022. He is able to give you 20 points in his sleep and is shooting over 55% from the field in 7 games while leading Cleveland to a winning record.

**6 John Wall (53)**

Modern medicine is amazing and Wall is proof of this. While not in elite status anymore, similar to Derrick Rose, Wall is proving that he provides value still.

**7 Joe Harris (70)**

Harris has fit in well with the now star studded Nets, shooting over 51% from the 3 so far and looks to be a key piece looking to contend.

**8 Myles Turner (71)**

Turner is low-key on pace to potentially have the best season of his career, shooting over 70% inside the 3 while averaging an insane 3.6 BPG so far. He's shooting more 3's and if his efficiency from there can improve, he could be a top 50 player by season's end.

**9 Julius Randle (76)**

I'm skeptical if the Knicks can keep up this level of success the whole year but Randle's career-best play so far cannot be denied. He's improved in all areas, even defense where he is a plus defensive player for the 1st time in his career. 

**10 Christian Wood (78)**

Wood is quickly moving up my overall list at this rate. He's drawn praise from James Harden and has quickly become a favorite on this sub due to his perseverance in overcoming adversity.

**11 DeJounte Murray (79)**

Murray's game is limited by lack of 3-point-shooting but he does everything else well for a point guard and has nice size. His scoring load has increased by about 30% from the previous season and has come up big in games such as 21 points in a win vs. the Clippers last night.

**12 Mike Conley (87)**

Conley's 1st season in Utah was a disappointment, but so far this season he is starting to change the narrative on him. With solid averages of 18.6 PPG, 5.0 APG, and 4.1 RPG, Conley is proving that he can still be effective as he enters his mid-30's.

**13 Jordan Clarkson (94)**

Clarkson has turned into one of the more underrated scorers off the bench in the league. He is currently averaging 15 PPG on career-best efficiency and has cracked my top 100. He just needs to stop pushing refs.

**14 Seth Curry (98)**

Seth has now cracked my top 100 for the 1st time ever. He is the x-factor behind Philly's success and is averaging over 15 PPG on over 54% shooting from 3 and Seth has not missed a free throw this year. 

**15 Terrence Ross (108)**

I don't think anybody expected Ross to average nearly 21 PPG so far. He has career-bests 41% from 3 and a 20.8 PER. If he continues playing at this pace, he will move into the top 100 quickly.

**16 RJ Barrett (116)**

Barrett has become a dangerous weapon and despite not being drafted to the greatest situation, he is inching closer to a top 100 spot in his 2nd year. However, he is one of the worst 3-point-shooters in the league currently and that needs to improve.

**17 Markelle Fultz (128)**

The eye test shows clear improvement and he has moved up on my list a tiny bit from last year, but his shooting efficiency has regressed. There's a lot to like still, the athleticism is incredible and his playmaking has improved. But the progression of his shooting will determine whether he will be a clear top 100 talent or a more athletic Elfrid Payton.

**18 Mikal Bridges (138)**

To go along with being a favorite of defensive analytics, Bridges is also shooting over 46% from 3 so far this year. Unquestionably, the addition of Chris Paul has helped Mikal continue to progress and at this rate he will be near the top 100 by the end of the year.

**19 Deandre Hunter (148)**

Hunter's reviews after his rookie year were really not good, but he's showing why he was picked 4th overall in his 2nd year. Hunter's offensive game has developed as he is currently shooting over 48% from 3 while averaging nearly 16 PPG. He still has a little bit to go before top 100 after a bad rookie year, but he's looking good.

**20 Avery Bradley (192)**

Bradley's role wasn't expected to be as big as it was but he's taking advantage, averaging 13 PPG on 59% shooting from the field and over 52% from 3. It's only been 5 games but Bradley is looking promising so far.",20 Players Progressing Rapidly
"His last video was on December 25th.
They've been using a number of other people to voice the high lights but they don't make rhymes or do the topten thing at the end.",What happened to the NBA Top Ten guy?
"Hey all, big time NBA fan here. 

I follow basketball on all of my social media platforms. I can’t get enough of it. The personalities of the players, the athleticism, showmanship, teamwork, the statistics, and especially the camaraderie between players on the courts which is really quite beautiful to see so many talented people being able to share their passion and talents with one another, much like when artists collaborate. On top of it all, the NBA in particular is lead gloriously by Commissioner Adam Silver, who has proven how deeply empathetic and intelligent he is since taking over the league. He is a stand up guy, a person who everyone can look up to in how he handles social issues and impossible tasks. Look how he handled The Bubble. Crazy. What I’m trying to get to is that Adam Silver seems to care about people. And he cares about the players. He’s embraced the idea of players around the league opening up about mental health issues, and seems to focus more on their well beings than business operations, which is very unlike many people ‘on top’. With all this being said, it would seem that the rest of the NBA community would share the same empathy for human beings. 

When I read articles and basketball news, I like to read the comments to see how others are thinking (why I still do this, I don’t know). I’m met with TOP comments full of unnecessary hate, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and blatant disrespect towards other commenters and especially the players. Some of these comments are obvious trolls, but others are sincere and I’m baffled how anyone can say some of these things about other human beings. The PG interview last night where he explained how he hasn’t felt this much hate from the community in his 10 years in the league is sad. 

The WNBA page is the worst. Every comments section is riddled with hurtful things about women having no place in basketball, how they should “get back in the kitchen”, and how they’re just plain “boring” to watch. This is their passion. Their life. They’ve dedicated themselves to this life of hard work and training and you’re grading them as “boring”.

I don’t care for the argument “ehh they have no place to whine, they’re millionaires”. A lot of these players are good people with good hearts. They help their communities and donate to charities. They have families. They have humility. They’re human beings. 

Imagine if you dedicated your entire life to your passion only to have strangers screaming in your face, cursing you out, and narrating your reputation on the internet about the flaws in your passion. Wouldn’t feel very good, would it? 

We can be better, basketball community. There’s a fine line between competitive spirit and being an arrogant ass.",The NBA community should not be this toxic.
"The teams in the bubble had the shortest offseason ever and the teams that didn't had the longest. Obviously the teams that made the bubble were better in the first place, but relative to where they were expected to be this season: are the teams that were in the bubble overperforming or underperforming? 

Knicks are way ahead of where I thought they would be and it looks like some of the guys really took the long offseason to work hard and came in in great shape. Haven't watched a lot of the rest of the league to get a feel if that's a wider trend though.",Was being in the bubble a handicap or advantage for teams coming into this season?

"*assume both of these young stars sustain good performances*

Domas is easily the better passer. He’s probably the 2,3,4 best passing big man in the league. Both of them are relatively shot on defense, but Domas blocked a Boogie poster!

Randle is probably the better shooter, as however much Domas improved, Randle has reached god tier on efficiency.

At Rim: 58% vs 77%

3-10 ft: 41% vs 30%

10-16 fr: 52% vs 0%

Context: The Cavs signed 6-foot-9 power forward Dean Wade in July of 2019, and the 24-year-old is now in his second season with the squad. 

Dwyane took a shot at himself in his remark, noting how he had a rather forgettable stint with the Cavs. The former 13-time All-Star played just 46 games for Cleveland during the first half of the 2017-18 season. The Cavs eventually traded him to the Heat in exchange for a second-round pick. In his brief tenure as a Cavalier, Dwyane averaged 11.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists in 23.2 minutes per contest.

What do you think Duncan Robinson’s free agency value is so the 21’ FA class? And what player and contract does it compare to?,Duncan Robinson FA Value?
"Do you see that lineup as a bonafide contender if Phoenix had taken Luka?  

They would be in prime position to compete for the next decade easily.  

Booker/Luka are 2 bonafaide #1 options at their current age.  You can't say that about a lot of other teams in the league.

Current teams that have a duo of All NBA guys are

- Lakers 

- Nets

- Clippers",Luka/Booker/CP3 -- What Could've Been?
"Free throws are not taken during the regulation game time.  They accumulate throughout the game and then after regulation both teams take their free throws.  If the score difference at the end of the game is such that the losing team still can't win if they make all their free throws and the winner misses theirs, then the free throws are just skipped.  

This will have the following benefits on the game:

* Eliminate flopping because you won't get the stoppage and free throws immediately.  And your might not get them at all depending on the points you got from normal shots.  Points from normal shots become much more valuable.
* Eliminate intentional fouling at the end of the game.  It does nothing for you now.


This will fix a lot of the problems that the NBA has.",[Discussions] Ideas to eliminate flopping and reduce game stoppage
"What's crackin. *Proof\_Tadpole* is back with another ranking list. We went over point guards, so today we are going over the top 10 small forwards entering the 2020-2021 NBA season. Gonna keep this intro short and sweet.

Note: This is a personal opinionated ranking of the small forwards I think would have a good 2020-2021 season. This is not to be considered as fact. I would also like to mention that with how the game is being played (positionless basketball), what you might think is a small forward, might not be a small forward for me (I would also like to let y'all know that my shooting guard post flopped a lot because of my ranking, which I take the blame for. I would like to thank y'all for the criticism, as it helps me improve on how I see basketball. At the end of the day, we are all fans of the game, and all of your opinions help me to better understand this wonderful game So once again, thank you, and hopefully this list can be somewhat of a come back). So if we disagree, I would like to let y'all know that our definitions are different, and that is okay; we just have to agree to disagree. Also shoutout to Andy Hoops for the inspiration. With that being out of the way, let us begin.

1. Lebron James- This is a no brainer. Like I could just leave it at that, but y'all know I am not going to do that. Last year, The King averaged 25.3 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 34.8% from the field on 6.3 attempts per game (which was the most threes he shot per game in an entire season). He also grabbed 7.8 rebounds a game and lead the whole league in assists at 10.2 assists per game, and ended up placing second place in MVP voting (which he seemed to have a problem with, as he tweeted out ""Only 16 First Place votes"" with 3 laughing emojis. He also said in an interview that he was pissed off about the MVP voting). He then turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 27.6 points on 56.0% shooting from the field and 37.0% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. He played out of his mind in the finals, averaging 29.8 points on 59.1% from the field and 41.7% on 6.0 attempts per game, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game. These numbers and the well coached Lakers team overcame the Heat in 6 games to bring the Larry O'Brian back to Los Angeles, and he was awarded finals MVP for his performance (which was a no brainer), where he said that he finally wanted his ""damn respect"", which he earned based off the performance he had in the playoffs. This season, I expect the Lakers to repeat as NBA champions, and I expect Bron Bron to lead the way (although, I do not expect them to get that top seed like they did last year, as I expect them to cruise through the regular season, and turn it up an notch in the playoffs, where I expect Bron to do most of his damage). At the end of the day, Bron is the best small forward and best player in the league, no doubts about that pick.
2. Kevin Durant- The reason why this list is coming out a little late was because I wanted to see some games from KD. Although the Nets record might be looking a little suspect (besides the first couple of games, that defense is cracking), KD's play has been phenomenal. In 6 games, the mans is averaging 28.2 points on damn near 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% from the field and 45.5% from three on 5.5 attempts per game), 7.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists. Add to that he looks really good (like the achilles tear never happened. Like bro looks like he got new bunnies) and his effort on the defensive end is also there, so he is well on his way to making a full recovery. And even if you didn't want to take in these stats because of the sample size, lets travel back to the 2018-19 season, where the slim reaper averaged 26.0 points on 52.1% shooting and 35.3% shooting from three on 5.0 attempts per game, bringing down 6.4 rebounds, and dishing out 5.9 assists per game (which only earned him an All-NBA Second Team selection). He then turned it up to a whole other level in the playoffs, averaging 32.3 points on 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% shooting from the field, 43.8% from three on 6.7 attempts per game, and 90.3% from the line on 9.3 attempts from the charity stripe), grabbed 4.9 boards and had 4.5 assists a game, before the strained right calf he suffered in the Houston series. He was the game changer in the NBA Finals, as he returned for Game 5 when the warriors were down 3-1. He scored 11 points in the first quarter, however, while trying to post up Ibaka, he ended up suffering an achilles tendon injury (which honestly doesn't seem to bother him at all). I have high expectations for the Nets, as I expect them to compete in a rather stacked Eastern Conference, and I expect KD and Kyrie to lead the way for them to reach their potential.
3. Kawhi Leonard- Mr. Terminator finds himself at the number 3 spot for obvious reasons.  In the 2019-20 season, Kawhi averaged 27.1 points on 47.0% shooting from the field and 37.8% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.1 rebounds and dished out 4.9 assists per game. He also played great defense (but not to the level that the media and a lot of fans were hyping it up to be, as he had to spend more time and energy on the offensive side of the glass, as the mans was a very integral part of the Clippers offense). His performance on the court rightfully earned him a second team all-NBA selection and a second team all-defense selection. The only problem with Mr. Leonard was that of his load management issues, as people outside of the Clippers bubble thought that this action of his would eventually bite him the back, as they speculated that the team would not have any proper chemistry with each other with the limited amount of games and practices that Kawhi would have with the other players (add that with the fact that Paul George was coming off that shoulder surgery, so the team really could not gel well with one another). The Clippers did seem to have a hot hand around February, but that momentum was squashed when the pandemic hit. Fast forward to late August in the bubble, and wouldn't you have guessed it, the Clippers are struggling in the playoffs. They barely beat Luka and the Mavs in 6 games, got up 3-1 against the Nuggets, and then forgot how to play basketball, as they ended up blowing that 3-1 lead and the series. Now, we all know Paul George wet the bed, but half of the blame is to be put on Kawhi as well (especially with that game 7 shooting, like my god). The stats may show you one thing (as he had good playoff numbers), but the eye test shows you something completely different (like, this was the first time I felt Kawhi was just out of it). But regardless, the past is in the past, and with the additions of Ibaka and Luke Kennard, I still have this team in contention in the west. Now, it is very likely they are not getting past the Lakers, but if they end up seeing them in the playoffs, I expect that to be a good series. So overall, got some pretty solid expectations (I guess more grounded than last year) for Kawhi, and hopefully he can bounce back and forget the disaster that was the 2020 playoffs.
4. Jimmy Butler- Imagine if Rock Lee from Naruto or Asta from Black Clover were an NBA player; you got yourselves Jimmy Butler. He essentially had nothing from the start, but through hard work, dedication, and a killer mindset, was able to go from a 30th overall draft pick who was seen as a glue guy coming off the bench for his defensive skills (so somewhat like Marcus Smart, side note: not hating on Marcus Smart), to a max player and leader of the team that earned their spot in the NBA finals. Coming into the 2019-20 NBA season, Butler was viewed as a locker room cancer and a player that was ""uncoachable"", which lead to a lot of people questioning his decision to sign with the Heat (as he was viewed as a person who wanted to win, but he left the situation he had in Philadelphia, a team that was a couple bounces away from going to overtime with the Raptors, and possibly going to the NBA Finals). A lot of people outside Miami slept on the heat, saying that they would just be a fringe playoff team, and that the signing of Butler was just so that they could put seats in the American Airlines Arena. But straight off the rip, the Heat ad Butler surprised many. Although Butler's 19.9 points on 45.5% shooting and 24.4% shooting from three on 2.1 attempts per game does not look like that of a player belonging on a top 5 spot, the intangibles he brings to the game is what sets him apart from other superstars (and yes, he is a superstar). He had a career high 6.0 assists and 6.7 rebounds per game, to go along with 1.8 steals per game (which truly does not depict his defensive value, as he is such an amazing defensive player, and the leader of that strong Miami defense along with Bam Adebayo). Even after the stellar regular season, a lot of people were still sleeping on the Heat, saying that they would be a second round out at best. However, in the NBA playoffs, Miami and Butler turned up the heat (pun intended). Despite his playoff numbers not being that eye-popping (22.2 points on 48.8% shooting from the field and 34.9% shooting from three on 2.0 attempts per game, 6.5 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.0 steals a game), Butler always kept the Heat in check, and always set the tone for what was one helluva finals run. He went off in the NBA Finals, averaging 26.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game on 55.2% shooting from the field and 30.8% from three, pushing the Lakers to 6 games, despite loosing Goran Dragic and Bam for the majority of that series, and proved to everyone on the planet that he was a winning player, rightfully squashing all of his negative baggage that came with him. Although the Heat seem to be struggling to start off the season (which is expected as they are coming off the shortest off-season in NBA history), I expect them to figure themselves out by the middle of the season, and I expect them to be the same dark horse (because I am just gonna keep it a bean, the Heat are legit), and I expect Jimmy to lead this team, hopefully for another deep playoff run (I really hope this man can get a ring. I loved him on the 76ers, and I was sad that we didn't choose to resign him, but I am happy that he is in a better situation now. Hopefully he don't get that Rock Lee treatment, cuz they did him dirty in Naruto. But like no cap, he do be like Asta doe. Like everyone hated on him, now everyone understands his struggles and appreciates him. Dubs in the comments if you a Black Clover fan, cuz we getting recognized).
5. Jayson Tatum- If Butler is a combination of Rock Lee and Asta, then I guess Tatum think he Deku cuz he thinking that the ""Mamba Mentality"" is like one for all (I know it is corny, and I am so sorry. But for real though, Tatum do be thinking he Kobe, which is not a knock against him, but still. Also, Deku's associated with Green and Tatum on the Celtics, so that reference is hopefully not completely off). Ignoring the corny ass anime reference (which hopefully at least one of y'all get), Tatum is without a doubt a budding star (hell, he is a borderline superstar at this point), and last season was officially his breakout year. In the 2019-20 season, Taco Jay averaged 23.4 points on 45.0% shooting from the field and 40.3% from three on 7.1 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.0 rebounds and dished out 3.0 assists, which earned him the accolade of third team all-NBA. He also contributed to a very elite perimeter defense that was in Boston, and grew to becoming the leader of that young Celtics team. Like Butler, Tatum turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 25.7 points on 43.4% shooting from the field and 37.3% from three on 7.4 attempts per game. He also grabbed 10.0 rebounds and dished out 5.0 assists a game, leading the C's to the Eastern Conference Finals, and were two games away from making the NBA Finals. So far into the young season, Tatum and the Celtics have been looking very good despite that rocky start to the season. This season, I expect the Celtics to take another step in the right direction and to see growth from both Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum (like, I know he grew more into a leader last season, but it always felt like he put up the stats, and guys like Brown, Smart, and Walker were the leaders of that team). I expect him to make an all-NBA, all-Defense (which he was lowkey snubbed for last season), and possibly get some MVP votes.
6. Paul George- I want to preface this by saying that this is not a knock against Mr. Playoff P. We all know that Paul George is going to be great in the regular season (I mean, mans right now is playing like an MVP Candidate, averaging 25.1 points on 50.8% shooting from the field, 49.2% shooting from three on 8.7 attempts per game, and 92.9% shooting from the charity stripe. He is also dishing out 5.1 assists and grabbing 5.7 rebounds per game. He also seems to have a better start with this Clippers team as opposed to last year, as he knows his role on the offensive and defensive side of the floor). But I am not gonna sit around and not mention the atrocity that was ""Pandemic P"" in last season's playoffs, which is the main reason why he is this far down. In the 2020 playoffs, Paul George averaged 20.2 points on 39.8% shooting from the field and 33.3% shooting from three on 8.5 attempts per game, brought down 6.1 rebounds, and dished out 3.8 assists per game. Basically mans switched from playing like an all-NBA player, to a bench player who was brought into the 15 man roster from the G-league, who is trying his hardest to stay on the team. Again, I am not implying that Paul George is bad (in fact, he is pretty good), but all I want from him is consistency. He needs to prove to the basketball community that he is a reliable option in the playoff, and that he isn't just a regular season player.
7. Brandon Ingram- Last year, Brandon Ingram officially had his breaking out season. After being traded to New Orleans from Los Angeles in the Anthony Davis trade, Ingram was able to flourish in his new playing environment. Although the Pelicans were a pretty underwhelming team (kinda falling sort of expectations I guess), Brandon Ingram did not disappoint, averaging 23.8 points on 46.3% shooting from the field and 39.1% shooting from three on 6.2 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.2 rebounds and dished out 4.2 assists per game, which earned him an all-star selection (also got some high respect from one Kevin Durant, noting that his game was very similar to his, saying that he has potential to be an elite player in this league), and won him the Most Improved Player award (although, I personally felt like it should have went to Bam Adebayo). Despite his statistical growth, he showed a lot of promise on the defensive end of the floor and he was able to be the go-to scoring option for this team down the stretch (basically, him being a jack of all traits player in the beginning of his career, which hurt him, is now pretty beneficial for him now). To start off this season, BI has looked strong, averaging 25.0 points on 44.8% shooting from the field and 38.6% from three on 6.3 attempts per game. He is also flourishing as a playmaker, averaging a career high 5.7 assists per game, while bringing down 6.4 rebounds per game. I expect the Pelicans to make some noise this season, and hopefully BI and Zion can lead this team to promising success in the future.
8. Khris Middleton- (These last three spots were very hard, so please do excuse me if I screw up here and there). Middleton finds himself here at number eight (like he is a good to great player and underrated, but at the same time, it really doesn't feel that way. Like, he is just an all-star player). If I were to just describe him, I guess all I can say is that he is somewhat of a second option to Giannis, in the fact that he scores his 20 points on good efficiency (to be more specific, he averaged 20.9 points on 49.7% shooting from the field and 41.5% shooting from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 6.2 rebounds, and had 4.3 assists per game). He is an above average defensive player and a vocal leader for this Bucks team. He has developed every single year in this tenure with the Bucks, and I expect nothing less from him this season as well (he is already averaging 20 points on 50-40-90 splits, so safe to say that he might end up being an all-star again if he keep this pace). His only problem is that of consistency, as like Paul George, Middleton struggled in the bubble, one of the main reasons why the Bucks were upset against the Heat in the second round. I expect the Bucks to remain competitive, and hopefully Middleton can find a way to solidify his position as the second star of this team.
9. Gordon Hayward- Despite that gruesome leg injury he suffered in the 2018 season and the rocky season he had in 2019, Hayward has relatively bounced back to being a productive starter to a borderline all-star type player. Last season he averaged 17.5 points on 50.0% shooting from the field and 38.3% from three on 4.3 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.7 rebounds and passed for 4.1 assists per game. He did not play a lot in the NBA playoffs, as he was coming off a grade 3 right ankle sprain which he suffered in the first round of the playoffs. He returned in game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, but he saw limited action, and the Celtics were taken out in 6 games. This season with the Hornets (who I really do not know where they will end up in the East), I expect to see increases in Hayward's stats (like as of right now, he is averaging 21.9 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 36.4% from three on 5.5 attempts per game. He is also averaging 5.8 boards a game and 4.4 assists per game). I highly doubt he will make an all-star tea, but I expect him to be some valuable veteran leadership for this young Hornets team.
10. Duncan Robinson- Robinson finds himself at number 10 to wrap up this list. It is pretty simple to explain his game: He is just a sniper bro. Last season, he averaged 13.5 points on 44.5% shooting from three on 8.3 attempts per game (which is crazy). He was integral to the Miami Heat's success, and although he is pretty shaky to start of the season and teams seem to be guarding him a bit tighter (he is still shooting like 41.1% from three), I expect him to good this season again. Him and Bam have good chemistry on those hand-offs by the elbows, so he will definitely get good looks from three. The Heat will make another run for it in the east, and I expect them and Robinson to turn it up when the time comes.

Honorable Mentions:

1. Robert Covington- I was debating between Roco and Robinson for the tenth spot. However, I looked into the Trailblazers roster, and he is playing the power forward this year (which I guess is expected based off his defense), so he is going to be in my power forward list.
2. Tobais Harris- Same thing I said with Roco. He plays heavy power forward minutes for the 76ers, a position that he blossomed in during his tenure with the Clippers under Doc Rivers, so expect to see him in the power forwards list
3. Joe Ingles- Again, very close with Robinson. But I went with Robinson based off how much he provided that Heat team with. The inside-out game plan of the heat was very fun to watch last year.
4. Andrew Wiggins- I do not know what the hell to expect from him at this point. One day he has an efficient game and the next he just bricks everything. He is very inconsistent
5. Michael Porter Jr.- Give him time. Just give him time and he will hopefully be a key piece to that Nuggets team.
6. T.J. Warren- Prayers up for a speedy recovery. That is all.

"Proven he could carry a mediocre team to a championship (2003), proven he could coexist with another superstar to win a championship (1999), proven he could consistently play well in the regular season (never missed playoffs, never had a season below 50 wins, two MVPs), had insane longevity (contended for 19 years straight, still a good player when he was old), won a lot of championships (5), coexisted with other stars and never had an ego in letting them share the glory (parker, Manu, Kawhi)

Only thing he hasn’t proven is winning without pop I guess.",Has any superstar proven it more than Tim Duncan?
"The Bulls won 6 titles in 8 seasons with Pippen and he's no doubt a historically great player. But I don't think he had the scoring punch of Wade. I personally rate peak D Wade as a top 15-20 player of all time, top 25 at worst. From 2003 to 2011, he played at an insane level both on offense and defense. I don't think Scottie qualifies as such.","Who do you think was better, peak Dwyane Wade or peak Scottie Pippen?"

I feel like I have seen this almost happen many many times but I've never actually seen it happen. So many times guys fall in the paint and there's guys around him jumping for the rebound.,Has a player ever falling down on the court and then another player accidentally jumps on their head?
"In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals. What do you think cause the drastic change in strategy in what were both do or die games?

I know the Clippers are touted as having more offensive options than Toronto had, but there were plenty of raptors that could get their own bucket also in Lowry, FVV, and Siakam... which they all proved in the finals.","In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals.

"Who you got and why? I got manu as he has a more varied skill set, pass, shoot, defend, size, less quick but more athletic in other ways. Where as parker seems is not as much of a two way player, and was a worse shooter. I watched them solely in the playoffs, but am curious what others think.",Who would have had a better career if they did not play for the spurs Manu Ginobili or Tony parker?
"I know Spain/Argentina/France/Slavic countries all had amazing talent on their roster, but I think we’d be the only non-USA team to field an entire roster of rotation pieces on NBA teams.

- Jamal Murray
- SGA
- Lu Dort
- Andrew Wiggins
- Dhillon Brooks
- RJ Barrett
- Chris Boucher
- Tristan Thompson
- Khem Birch
- Brandon Clarke
- Kelly Olynyk
- Cory Joseph

(Switch in Dwight Powell and NAW for some of the bigs if you want)","If every Canadian in the NBA is on board with playing in the olympics this year, would they be the most talented non-USA team ever?"
"Context:

&gt;Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future. Unlike other major revenue streams such as TV and ticket money, expansion fees are not split with players. Such a haul could mean about $160 million per team, a windfall that could wipe out the massive debt load that's piling up, and that alone has perked interest in the expansion path.

&gt;Considering there might be multiple offers from cities like Seattle or Las Vegas and that the league knows its business and its bidders, that could be a fair projection. But a potential Wolves sale of $1.5 billion or less would mean a correction in the NBA market after a decade of growth.

&gt;The Utah Jazz, who play in a much smaller market than Minneapolis, sold for $1.66 billion last month to tech billionaire Ryan Smith. That is a strong vote of confidence in the continued rise in franchise value -- but it might have been an outlier.

https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30652450/what-potential-timberwolves-sale-means-nba-expansion","[Windhorst] Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future."
"The NBA is already hard enough to watch right now because of the lack of crowds, and now we’re getting players resting on prime time games? It just stinks.

It makes sense for dudes like Demarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant and everyone that recently suffered serious injuries, but it doesn’t make sense to allow young healthy players to sit. Does the NBA just not care about the viewers? 

Maybe the solution is to significantly reduce the amount of games, and I’m okay with it. I’m all for *quality* over *quantity* in this instance. I’m a die hard Cavs fan, but I don’t watch close to every Cavs game because there are so damn many. I don’t think NBA fans would mind not having as many games if they actually got to see their favorite players play.",The NBA seriously needs to do something about resting players.
"I'll start, Wilt Chamberlain (flair checks out); not only was he an athletic freak of nature (most athletic player the sport has ever seen), he actually was very skilled at the game of basketball, he had a great post fade, was very nuanced in the post, and was a disciplined defender. There are some more deeper things i'd like to touch on but this is meant to be more for civil light discussion and not in depth analysis.",Which player has the most misconceptions attached to them?

"&gt;‘This is uncharted territory for most of us’ — Fred VanVleet on Raptors 1-5 start. ‘... we got a boatload of problems’

&gt;‘This game will break your heart ... this stuff keeps me up at night’ —
Fred VanVleet

Kyle Lowry chimed in on the Raptors issues as well

&gt;“Right now we have no swag to us ... teams are looking at us and saying let’s eat ... that’s not a good position at all’ — Kyle Lowry.

"So I heard a lot of stuff on how Levert is a really good player and will be the third star and all that stuff but so far he has looked pretty bad and has a abysmal TS. Now granted this is early and his percentages will might go up but as of now do you think he is overrated?

Just for reference Levert has the exact same TS as Siakam in the 2020 playoffs",Caris Levert so far this season 14.5/3.9/5.5 on 39/29/91 and a 46 TS%. Is he one of the most overrated players/assets in the NBA?

Herro: 14.3

Dragic: 13.8

Bradley: 13.0

Duncan: 11.2

Butler: 10.8

Olynyk: 10.4

Even with Butler's struggles due to his ankle injury, the Heat have had a ton of help from the supporting cast. Its impressive seeing such an ""everybody eats"" offense",The Heat currently have 7 players averaging double digits in ppg this season.
"After a rusty start to the season, DLo had his best game so far against Denver. Really loved to see his synergy with Vanderbilt and the fact that he got more to the FT line. 

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267264","DLo tonight vs. the Nuggets: 33 points and 11 assists on 10/21 FG, 4/9 3PT and 9-10 FT"

"Rubin had the opportunity to purchase the 76ers in 2011 when he was approached by then-majority owner Ed Snider. Rubin declined and months later joined the bid of Josh Harris and David Blitzer. Rubin is also executive chairman of Fantics.

“I only did it because David Stern told me to do it,” Rubin told Sports Illustrated. “Good owners aren’t buying franchises because they think it’s a good economic deal. They’re buying franchises because they’re a huge fan of the sport and they want to be a steward of that team. If they just do it because of a good economic deal, they’re going to be bad owners.”

"You can look at years where maybe one Conference was stacked af, but I don't remember the last time so many teams were enjoyable to watch imo and even if they're not going anywhere are worthwhile and dangerous on paper any given night. 

**The West:** Obviously the Clippers, Lakers, Jazz, Warriors, Blazers, Mavericks, Rockets(with Harden), Nuggets are good watchable teams in the West. The Suns have a really good crew this year too though with CP3/Booker/Mikal/Ayton etc. Obviously the Pelicans are a big attraction with playoff hopes. No one has the Wolves in the running, but a team on paper with DLo, Beasley, Rubio, KAT, Culver, and #1 pick AntEdwards is worth watching. I'd look forward to my Sixers playing them to see those guys, they have two stars and a potential third. The Kings and Spurs aren't *bad*, they have good watchable and interesting players, and when Morant and JJJ returns the Grizzlies are certainly a fun young team. The only team left out is the tanking OKC who at least is interesting in the long run with their haul of picks. That's the entire conference. 

**The East:** We're used to a stacked West, but the East is where things really change. Again, Sixers, Pacers, Celtics, Bucks, Heat, Nets were all obvious standout teams in the Conference. That being said, Orlando made the playoffs last year and is off to a good start, and the Cavs actually have an intriguing rotation with Sexland/Okoro/Love/Drummond and guys like KPJ/Cedi/Nance/McGee as well. I think the Hawks have a legit squad there, they look 10 deep to me when healthy with a young(get it) superstar to lead the way. The Hornets have Rozier/Graham/Hayward/Bridges in the starting 5 and LeMelo is a treat off-the-bench. The Bulls have Zach and Coby making an exciting backcourt, a high pick in PatWill, Lauri, Wendell, etc. The Wizards have a backcourt that can kill you any given night with Rui, Deni, Bertans, Thomas Bryant, etc. They aren't elite teams, but they're certainly watchable and they're not a joke imo. Toronto is struggling, but I'll still give them time to bounce back. They certainly have good players. I've covered everyone except the Knicks who are off to a good start, and Detroit is clearly tanking. I won't pass any judgement on the Knicks yet, but that's 13/15 teams I can confidently look at and like. 

When was the last time in the league where even if I'm being personally picky can look at let's say 25/30 teams and say they have good talent and are truly worth watching? I love where the NBA is at right now, I think so many fans have a reason to be excited about their teams. Almost no game feels like a free win coming into it. I personally really hope the league doesn't expand, because this is special.",Talent Distribution in the League is the BEST it's been in years
"Since guys like Pau Gasol and Tyson Chandler aren’t on a roster, that leaves LeBron, Melo, Korver, and Udonis Haslem as the only players that have been in the league since 2003. And because LeBron was taken 1st overall in the draft ahead of Melo and Korver,  and Haslem wasn’t signed until August, technically LeBron has been here longer than anyone else.

Truly insane that the best player in the league is also the league’s longest tenured.[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_and_youngest_National_Basketball_Association_players#)",LeBron James has actually been in the NBA longer than any other current player
"Obviously, the chances of either one of these individuals making it to the NBA is astronomically low, but I thought this would be a fun post. And G-league counts as ""making it"" in the NBA in this case. 

Julian Newman was ""hyped"" to be a type of scoring phenom, and played against varsity basketball players when he was just in fifth grade. He has a good amount of games of scoring a ton of points, but is quite the selfish player. Moreover, he is listed at just 5 foot 7 inches tall, and that even seems generous.

Rapper Sheck Wes played in basketball but didn't go to college. Despite that, he declared for the 2020 draft and no team picked him up. He's just 6 foot 2 inches tall, but still was able to sign for Paris Basketball in LND Pro B, which is a second tier professional basketball league in France. I couldn't find many videos of him balling, but apparently he's somewhat decentish.

"Snippets from a new interview with Bogdan:

&gt; “When the news (of the alleged Bucks-Kings deal) came out, we were like, ‘What the fuck?’” Bogdanovic said during a half-hour phone conversation with The Athletic last week. “I didn’t know what was going on. I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure what was going on.”

&gt; ...while Bogdanovic didn’t clarify much about the Bucks’ involvement and why they appeared to believe he was willing to come their way, he made two other strong viewpoints very clear: **The idea that Antetokounmpo recruited him hard directly was overblown, and he wasn’t pleased at how the Kings be-traded him along the way**

&gt;Yes, you read that right. And in a weird sort of way, Bogdanovic’s made-up word made perfect sense.

&gt; “It’s not the part that you were traded (that bothered him),” he said. “But it’s more like you feel a little be-traded. No one let you know about it.”

&gt; ""I remember (the Kings) called me right after they were talking with Vlade — bla bla — and they said, ‘We still want to be the same team, we still want you to (be on the team). You’re a big piece of it, you’re a big part of it.’ Bla, bla, bla. ‘We want to keep you,’ and all those stories. You know, it just caught me off guard, really.

&gt; When someone breaks that trust level, when someone does that, from that point you don’t believe them anymore, you know?""

&amp;#x200B;

Curry can’t take 31 shots and attempt 19 free throws every game like he did on Sunday, but the Warriors do need him to dominate the ball more than he did in their first five games. Before Sunday, Curry touched the ball in the half court 31 times per 36 minutes, a lower rate than any season since Mark Jackson was still the head coach in 2013-14, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Even his brother, Seth Curry, averaged more half-court touches (33.2), as did 86 other players. That changed on Sunday, as Curry set season highs in total touches (88), half-court touches (44), and time possessing the ball (6.6 minutes).

The Warriors won’t and shouldn’t have Curry do his best James Harden impression by running countless pick-and-rolls and isolations. Taking on such a massive workload wouldn’t be wise for a 32-year-old with a lot of miles on his 6-foot-3, 185-pound body. But they do need a higher-usage version of Curry more often. This would mean having him serve as more of an on-ball creator, while balancing that role with his off-ball brilliance.",Stephen Curry was only averaging 31 touches per game on offense *(before 62 pt game) - less then Seth

"Let’s say the team is historically bad like the Process Era Sixers or the 2012 Bobcats, so they are starting from the ground up.

"Context:

&gt;**So with the Milwaukee situation, what was your experience and your side of that whole situation?**

&gt; just couldn’t believe everything was happening like that, you know? Nothing was in my hands, really. When I saw that tweet about the Milwaukee stuff, I really saw it on Twitter. It’s not bullshit. That’s why I felt caught off guard.

&gt;(Before free agency, and soon after the Kings fired former general manager Divac in mid-August), I remember (the Kings) called me right after they were talking with Vlade — bla bla — and they said, ‘We still want to be the same team, we still want you to (be on the team). You’re a big piece of it, you’re a big part of it.’ Bla, bla, bla. ‘We want to keep you,’ and all those stories. You know, it just caught me off guard, really.

&gt;When someone breaks that trust level, when someone does that, from that point you don’t believe them anymore, you know? I think it was unfair a little bit because I didn’t even get a call or nothing (from the Kings) and it was 2 a.m. in my country (when the news broke). I was just confused. I remember waking up the next morning, seeing my phone just blowing up. ‘What was happening? What happened?’ Bla, bla, bla. Ah, you got traded to Milwaukee. I said, ‘Like, how can I get traded (when he’s a restricted free agent)?’

&gt;My agent was explaining the whole summer (that in) restricted free agency, we’re waiting for offers and that’s it, you know? If the Kings don’t want to give us a good offer, (or) they offer me the same money they offered me the last time and they didn’t want to go more than that, or they want me to check the market (that’s fine). They’d talked to my agent about checking the market, and I was fine. And then, that was the deal with the Kings. That’s what my agent told me. And I talked personally with them as well.

&gt;**So if I’m hearing you right, did you stop thinking about Milwaukee at that point because the league seemed determine to make sure that didn’t happen?**

&gt;Yeah, honestly, I didn’t even make a decision about it. It was three days where something is happening and I didn’t even decide nothing, you know? I wasn’t even involved. I wasn’t even involved, and it’s about me — which is crazy.

"For teams, it's the ultimate get out of jail free card in that they don't have to trade assets or pay off the rest of their contracts in the event of buyout or amnesty. For expansion teams, their incentive to get decent players since they're just starting up.

The obvious one for me off the bat is Kevin Love. The Cavs would have to trade draft picks and young players in order to trade Kevin Love. I don't think you can get anything of value for Kevin Love at this point in time. I still think he's a good player but I don't know if he's worth the 30 million that he's making at this point in time.

Al Horford has a good chance of not getting protected. The Thunder have somehow found a way to get first round picks in any circumstance. I just don't know why a team would trade for Al Horford at this point in time due to his age.

Another one is probably John Wall. It really depends on where the Rockets are at that point in time. If Harden is traded and they're rebuilding, Wall could be gone. Most of it depends on how they want to build their roster going forward.

Tobias Harris is a possible candidate. I think Tobi is good but they're basically paying LeBron money for a borderline All-Star in the East. Philly could just use the expansion draft as a way to create cap space to get more depth if needed. This one really hinges on whether Philly believes they can get something of value for him in a trade.

If the Clippers don't get past the second round again, Marcus Morris might not get protected. Marcus Morris is a decent player but paying him $16 million every year until he's 35 feels like an overpay.

What other players fall into this category?","If an expansion draft happens, which teams would take advantage of it by trying to get off bad contracts? Which players are in danger of not getting protected?"
"I was not following the Kings very closely at the time, but I seem to recall the Kings trading Cousins during the 2016-17 season to the Pelicans being a pretty big surprise.

"I know we're only 8 games into the season(and I'm a homer), but I'm so happy seeing young talent blossom in Boston. Brown is making a very strong case to be an all-star this year, and Tatum, while sometime frustrating shot selection, has proven capable of shining in big moments and delivering. It'll be interesting to see how their stats will be affected once the C's get Kemba back, it's likely Brown might score less/Tatum will assist less, but not quite sure.","Celtics' Jay duo to start the season: Brown 27/4/3 on 63.8 eFG%, Tatum 26/7.5/4 on 55 eFG%, multiple game winners."

"With 5 minutes 39 seconds remaining in the 4th quarter the Grizzlies were given a 3 second defensive violation.  In every box score/play by play I’ve seen (espn, bballref, nba.com) Dennis Shroder is credited with attempting and making the free throw.  From watching the game I’m almost positive it was actually AD who took that free throw.  If that is the case his totals for the game should be 3-4 FT and 27 total points, not 2-3 and 26 as box scores currently show.  Does anyone have tape of the game and if I’m correct how would I go about letting these stats providers know there is a mistake?",Incorrect Box Score From Last Night’s Lakers/Grizzlies Game
"Is there any good reason why it wouldn't be a good idea to only award FTs to attempts that make it to the rim or if the player is tied up at the rim after a clear path or something. If the ball doesn't hit the rim on a shooting foul, it's a side OB with 14 or 24s on the shot clock. This way, we don't have to change the way in which offensive players use FTs for efficiency, but it will disincentivize the really blatant shot fake 3pt fouls where the shooter literally jumps into the flying defender and flails the ball 20ft away from the rim. I just think that type of foul should only be awarded if the shot was headed for the basket.",A possible way to easily reduce the amount of FT stoppage in modern NBA games

That being said, can we try and compile a list of YouTubers that are your go-to for breakdowns and analysis? They don't have to be doing stuff daily but if I can find a channel or two to help me understand each team, during any given week, it would be pretty helpful.

So I would probably take AD in situations where there are elite or mlutiple playmakers on a team, and Jokic otherwise.",Who would you rather have? Jokic or AD?

&gt; Yet while Bogdanovic didn’t clarify much about the Bucks’ involvement and why they appeared to believe he was willing to come their way, he made two other strong viewpoints very clear: The idea that Antetokounmpo recruited him hard directly was overblown, and he wasn’t pleased at how the Kings be-traded him along the way.

&gt; **We (Thanasis and Bogdanovic) are friends. We are friends, you know? I talked with him once monthly, once every two months. So we talk about it — we talked maybe in the bubble, not about me coming there, nothing like that. But we were like, ‘Ah, you guys are good,’ — bla, bla, bla, you know? Normal things. How is your family? Basketball things, we didn’t even talk about it because I know that they are professionals and they respect my professionalism and we never talked about it. We really never talked about it. When the news came out, we were like, ‘What the fuck?’ I didn’t know what was going on. I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure what was going on.**

"First of all keep in mind this is coming from  the perspective of a greedy Sixers fan who wants to steal Kyle Lowry. That being said...

&amp;#x200B;

This is the perfect year to take a gap year for Toronto. There are basically no fans this year, and on top of that the Raptors are playing in Tampa f\*\*\*ing Bay. I can't imagine this is a fun season for any of the players, especially those with homes in Toronto. It's not fair for them but I wouldn't be surprised if some players would rather get this season over with before the playoffs anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Toronto has a promising young core. Fred, OG, Pascal (who I still believe in) are all locked up for the long haul. Why not get a chance to draft a superstar with a top 5 pick in a loaded draft? I don't even remember the last time Toronto was in the lottery (which is a compliment.)

"With expansion seeming more and more imminent by the day due to the losses the NBA needs to make up as a result of the pandemic, it is interesting to think about how the NBA will restructure after potential expansion. I've seen a good amount of proposals for realignment, but I believe this plan makes the most sense in terms of travel and historical precedent. This is of course assuming that the cities chosen are Seattle and Las Vegas, which I believe to be, by far, the most likely cities to get a team. Any other city is a long shot and would have to replace Las Vegas. 

The proposal involves 4 divisions of 8 teams in the traditional Western and Eastern Conferences and returns the NBA to a pre-2004 structure. The playoffs would be structured also like pre-2004 in which the division winners take the top 2 seeds, with the next 6 teams being ranked by their record. This gives meaning to the divisions along with encouraging divisional rivalries, which is something that is currently lacking in the NBA. This system also ensures that if the two best teams in a conference are in the same division, they will still have the opportunity to meet in the Conference Finals. The only downside, at least in the first couple seasons, is that both expansion franchises would be in the same division, but this is unavoidable unless Las Vegas is replaced with a city such as Montreal or Louisville.

My idea for the schedule is that each team would play 5 games against all 7 teams in their division (35 games), 4 games against 7 teams in the other conference division and 3 games against the remaining team in that division (31 games), and only 1 game against each team in the other conference (16 games), for the same normal 82 games that the league will never relinquish because of revenue. I'm 99% sure this idea would never be implemented but it's still an interesting concept that would really turn up the heat with divisional rivalries. 5 games against divisional foes would allow for 2 two-game mini-series plus a final meeting for each matchup during the regular season, which ensures that there would be a regular season ""winner"" for each matchup. These 5th games could all take place at the end of the season to make tiebreakers and division title races that much more intense, similar to how the NFL does it at the end of their seasons. I think the best part about this, however, is that it would decrease overall travel, which would better the quality of play and (maybe) decrease the amount of injuries we see.

# Pacific Division (Western Conference)

*This division is the Pacific Division of the pre-2004 NBA along with the addition of Las Vegas. It restores some old divisional rivalries that were broken up by realignment in 2004 such as Lakers-Blazers along with restoring the late 60s expansion trio of Seattle-Phoenix-Portland, who all 3 had multiple classic playoff series between each other during the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Finally, Las Vegas can form a desert rivalry with Phoenix and possibly an I-15 rivalry with the LA teams as well.*

# Southwest Division (Western Conference)

*This is the spiritual successor to the original Midwest Division that existed for 34 years, that pulls every team from the current Southwest Division plus 3 teams from the Northwest that are geographically Southwest. OKC finally is with the teams that they have had memorable playoff series with such as Houston, San Antonio, and Memphis. With Utah moving into this division, it keeps the possbility for a real Jazz-Nuggets rivalry along with strengthening the hatred between Jazz and Rockets fans. Travel would be a bit long from places like New Orleans/Memphis to Utah, but the historical precedent is there for Utah to be in this division (they were in the Midwest from 1979-2004) and New Orleans/Memphis will still have OKC and the Texas teams as close cities.*

# Central Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Central Division of the 90s minus Toronto and plus Minnesota, which will make travel far less tedious for the Timberwolves. This gives them the opprotunity to develop rivalries with teams that actually make sense for them, possibily mirroring NFC North rivalries. Charlotte and Atlanta may not make too much sense in terms of travel for this division, but both were in this division throughout the 90s with Atlanta going as far back as 1970. In my opinion, this historical precedent outweights removing a team like Toronto from the Atlantic and putting them here, given the great playoff series the Raptors have had with current divisional rivals (BOS, PHI) in recent years.*

Minnesota Timberwolves

Milwaukee Bucks

Chicago Bulls

Indiana Pacers

Detroit Pistons

# Atlantic Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Atlantic Division pre-2004 with the addition of the Raptors. I don't think breaking up the Southeast Division is too big of a deal given that Atlanta doesn't really have animosity towards Miami or Orlando that I know of. This also re-introduces the possbility for another Heat-Knicks rivalry one day which would be great for the league.*

Ultimately, this turned out to be a legendary performance. Some of you may remember back when the Western Conference really *did* make it impossible for you to succeed. The San Antonio Spurs were just as good as that extraordinary Kobe-Shaq Lakers team in some ways and also one of the best teams in the league for more than a decade. That ultra gritty, slowly grind your spirit into the ground type of culture was fueled by Duncan, Parker, and Ginobli, but was captained by a prime Gregg Popovich. They happened to come up against the Phoenix Suns in the 2010 playoffs and it would be no easy task, especially at the end of Game 3. This would be thoroughly proven when a European kid with very little playoff experience, and vicious fire in his eyes, gave the world something special to witness.

"Or rostered within the past couple of seasons, it doesn’t particularly matter. I’m looking solely for obscurity, not a commentary on the skill level of any specific player. I’ve been considering many different people for this designation, but have decided based on a combination of factors that this honor belongs to **Khem Birch**. 

I first learned this person existed close to the trade deadline last season. Upon further research, I’ve found that his entirely uninspiring numbers and limited role on a seldom-watched team have resulted in Khem Birch generating almost zero buzz over his flavorless four year career. I would wager that he has the least name recognition of any player in the league that actually sees minutes. 

Can anyone top the obscurity of the elusive Khem Birch?",Who is the most random/obscure player currently in the NBA?

"Hi guys, I wanna ask about NBA standings.

I know about the tiebreakers when the regular season ends and how they determine who’s gonna make it to playoff. 

What I wanna ask is: How do they rank teams who have the same W-L record when the regular season is still going? For example, in the Western Conference, there are currently 5 teams with 3-4 record, how do they rank these teams? Are there any criteria or they just put whoever get the record first on top?

I know this is super temporary and subject to change very soon after a few more games, and it does not matter that much at the beginning of the season (like now). But still I’m curious and I really want to know. I tried a Google search but all of the results seem to be end-season/playoff criteria.

"That draft class was the 1970 class, which included the legends **Bob Lanier**, **Pete Maravich**, **Geoff Petrie**, and **Dan Issel**.

Surprisingly enough, this draft class followed the year when Kareem-Abdul Jabber got drafted, so true situational irony where the the best offensive draft-class occurred after arguably the GOAT. 

Other years with multiple 20+ ppg scorers:

Year | Players 
:- | :-
1960 | Oscar Robertson, Jerry West 
1965 | Rick Barry, Billy Cunningham
1966 | Dave Bing, Lou Hudson
1970 | Pete Maravich, Bob Lanier, Geoff Petrie, Dan Issel
1972 | Julius Erving, Bob McAdoo
1974 | George Gervin, John Drew
1975 | David Thompson, World B Free
1976 | Alex English, Adrian Dantley
1977 | Marques Johnson, Bernard King
1984 | Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley
**Lottery Era** | **Players**
1985 | Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone
1996 | Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson

Not many surprising names on there, but it is surprising there are only two draft classes to produce more than 2 20+ ppg scorers.  It’s also surprising how after the lottery was introduced, everything changed to such an extent. It’s pretty mind-boggling.

Also keep in mind there’s many players right now who would fit these categories, but I decided to leave them off because their careers are not finished yet.

Something else that’s interesting is **1950-1953, 1954, 1957, 1963, 1964, 1967, 1971, 1979-1981, 1986, 1989-1991, 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2002** were the draft classes that didn’t produce *any* career 20+ ppg scorers. There were multiple with only one player, like 1992 with Shaquille O’ Neal.","[OC] From 1949-2003, Only 1 Draft-Class Produced More Than 3 Career 20+ PPG Scorers"

"I’m watching the Minnesota game and Denver just committed some sort of violation. I didn’t know what it was because I didn’t hear the whistle, I only saw the Denver players complaining in in unison and the ball switched sides.

I also noticed this happening sometimes in the Nets game, where I had to judge based off the player’s reactions, not the whistle.

Is this happening to anyone else? Might be because the synthetic crowd noises and music on the court are crazy loud.",Are the referees audible?
"If Seattle gets a team what does that mean for record books? And can they be named SONICS?

With Okc still in league, anyone have a good guess or a real answer on what would happen?

I think they would have to change their name and not be considered champions. I’m from Oregon would be great to get the PNW rivalry going. 

Thanks in advance",If Seattle gets a team what would that mean for the record books.
"As a new fan, I find it difficult to enjoy games and therefore feel less likely to watch future games. After watching the NBA for around 6 months, I find it very difficult to enjoy the game when I feel like the rules are arbitrary and difficult to understand in real-time.

I started watching the NBA after getting laid off from my banking job soon after the bubble restart. While I quickly picked up another job, I found that I wouldn't start until April and therefore had a significant amount of time for new hobbies. I quickly dove into the NBA and NHL to fill what previously was 100+ hour work weeks, watching every game I could and trying to understand as much as possible. 

Over the last 6 months, I have thoroughly enjoyed the bubble format of the NBA. The Lakers became my favorite team because of their lockdown defense (I'm currently enjoying watching the sixers more) and I went from illegally streaming games to paying for league pass.

However, I've come to a point where I feel like I should really understand what is a foul and what isn't, but being completely surprised 30-50% of the time a whistle is blown. The problem is two-fold. First, NBA broadcasts rarely show replays of fouls. While I understand there is significant fluidity to the game, it makes it difficult as a fan to come to see what is going on at a speed that I can digest it. Also, it makes it difficult to learn and understand the game as a fan. In contrast, the NHL shows replays of almost every penalty, and while there are still controversies, I feel like I can get a better understanding of the game and that rules are more fairly applied.

Tonight I had significant difficulty understanding and watching the lakers/grizzlies games due to the aforementioned issues. As a new fan, I find these incongruencies frustrating and am looking forward to the NHL start as a replacement for the NBA product.","The NBA product as a new fan, and why fouls are frustrating"
"Last night, I was watching the second half of the Pacers Pelicans game and I noticed something small I wanted to write about - I saw that the Pelicans’ closing lineup (Ball/Redick/Ingram/Williamson/Adams) ran a specific set a few times in order to get Ingram the ball in a position he likes. It looks like they start in a [box set](https://i.imgur.com/1cVZInN.jpg). Notice that **Ingram** is on the left low block and **Adams** is on the left elbow.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a [video](https://streamable.com/01zdc7) showing the 3 plays they ran out of this set.

&amp;nbsp;

To get into the box set, Lonzo brings the ball up, usually either down the middle or left side of the court. Adams goes to the left elbow, sets a back screen for Ingram who cuts to the left block. Then, Adams sets a down screen for Ingram, who comes off the screen ready to catch the ball on the left wing facing the basket (the videos show the action a lot better than my description). 

This action usually flows into an Ingram/Adams pick-and-roll on the left wing, or just an Ingram isolation. The unsung part of the play that really makes it work (in my opinion) is the way that the two other players, JJ Redick and Zion, are used. They usually don’t do much besides maybe screening for each other (to get Zion an easy dive to the rim or Redick a 3), but the threat of a Redick catch-and-shoot 3 or a Zion lob causes defenders to be more wary of them and prevents them from sending too much defensive attention to Ingram.

It seems like the best way to guard this is by using Lonzo’s man to dig down while Ingram has the ball and this could possibly blow up the pick and roll with Adams.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my summary of the three examples of the play in action during yesterday’s crunch time possessions:

&amp;nbsp;

[Possession 1](https://streamable.com/7r1jgz)

[Possession 2](https://streamable.com/vnv5lw)

[Possession 3](https://streamable.com/3madve)

&amp;nbsp;

In the first possession, the play flows into an Ingram/Adams PnR and Sabonis (Adams’ man) drops back to cover the Adams roll, Brogdon is caught up a little on the screen and neither man can credibly contest Ingram’s pull up jumper in the paint. Both McDermott and Sampson keep a careful watch on their own assignments and are unable to help much. Notably, McConnell (Lonzo’s man) is mostly out of the play. Result: **Ingram 2 pt basket on open paint jumper.**

&amp;nbsp;

In the second possession, the play again flows into the PnR action, and Brogdon is again slowed down by Adams’ excellent (totally not moving) screen. Adams’ man, this time Myles Turner, hedges to prevent the Ingram open 3, Ingram reads the play excellently and hits Adams on a dive to the rim. Notice that Justin Holiday (Lonzo’s man) digs down but since Turner is out of position Holiday and Sabonis can’t get there to help in time. Result: **Steven Adams dunk off pass from Ingram**

&amp;nbsp;

The third possession is an example of the play getting blown up. Lonzo’s man (Oladipo this time) digs down again as Ingram has the ball, but Adams decides not to set the screen (not exactly sure why) to give Ingram an isolation look with Brogdon. However, Adams’ man (Turner) is in an excellent position to wall Ingram off from the basket and then Oladipo’s positioning comes in handy once Ingram tries to go the other way. Brogdon does a great job of containing Ingram with the help of his teammates here. Result: **Ingram misses contested midrange jumper**",[OC] Pelicans late game offense: Using a box set to strengthen the Ingram/Adams two man game
"This is one aspect of his game I have wanted to monitor, considering how mediocre he was from three point range at UGA (29% on 8 attempts per game).  

Early returns are.... well basically what you would expect.  Dude needs to dial it back a notch with this Westbrook-esque bricklaying .","Anthony ""A1"" Edwards 3pt shooting this season: 29% on 6 attempts per game"
"Title explains itself

 Mines include 

Both Damian lillard buzzer beaters against Houston and OKC

Curry vs Okc 2016 

Kawhi Leonard's 2019 against the 76ers 

Jordan's 1989 buzzer beater vs the cavs 

Kobe 2009 vs D wade and the miami heat 

Theres alot more to cover and I cannot list them all 

What is yours?

Edit: I forgot Drose against Cleveland 2015

Edit II: last second shots count also idc",What is the best buzzer beaters in your opinion?
So Lou averages 52% FG when he makes the first shot and just 32% when he misses the first shot which is just absolutely insane. Does this theory apply to other players as well?,Is the lou Williams first shot theory real for other players too?
"He's legitimately been playing like a top 20 player for about the last 3 seasons, was an allstar in 2018 and should have been in 2019 (over Sabonis imo) and is probably the only reason Orlando hasn't been in the lottery the past 3 years. Orlando won't be bad this year that they would trade him and the Jrue Holiday trade probably upped his value because he has more term and is a better player which another team probably wont wanna pay the price. Its crazy the shift he had from an above average center from 2012 to 2017 to maybe the 4th best (after Embiid, Jokic, Gobert , and KAT in no particular order).",Is Nikola Vucevic the most underrated player in the nba?

"I was beginning to work my night ""shift"" and I was set to watch Nets vs Jazz, but I decided to switch to Lakers vs Grizzlies because of the commentator and play by play. He used to be the lead commentator on NBA and NFL on our ESPN (I'm from Brazil), now he's on another channel, but still on a NBA task. I usually don't pick a game just because of broadcasting in Portuguese, but whenever he is on the booth, I pick that game.

Do you have a favorite broadcast crew that you follow, no matter the game? Or vice versa, a crew that you hate so much that you skip every possible game with them on the booth, or just downright mute the broadcast?",Have you ever watched a game just because of the broadcast crew?
"Whether it be at some point this season, the playoffs, or the early part of next season, im just wondering how long the NBA is going to have empty arenas. What do you say?",Buy or Sell: We will see full NBA arenas again in 2021?
"He’s definitely regressed from 2016, but he is the absolute king of the little things that makes life much easier for Steph. Can run Kerrs offense which allows Steph to run off screens all day. Still a good defender and solid rebounder. Definitely still a solid player and Great rebounder for his size, and also can run plays for the warriors.",Draymond Green makes everyone on the Warriors so much better on both ends of the floor
"Been trying to find this out for about a year. They play it during intros, commercial breaks, etc. What song is it? I can't Shazam it because they're usually talking over it

Edit: Found it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXRCl3CR9v0",What's that rock music they use on NBA TV a lot? They just used it while talking about the Lakers

"Helped lead a comeback victory over the Hawks. I'm excited about this team, it seems like we have a lot of good young talent.",Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley played the entire fourth quarter tonight and finished with 16 points on 4/7 shooting from the field and 2/3 from 3
"He’s been out even during the pre season with “knee soreness” but to be out that long with that injury title is kinda weird. 

Batum has stepped up in his absence getting starter minutes but I assume he heads to the bench once Morris comes back (no way they payed him 16M to come off the bench) which could ruin his rhythm

It’s early but Batum looks like a better fit with Kawhi and PG so Ty Lue will have some decisions to make",So what happened to Marcus Morris?
"[Link to Gobert's response](https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/1346138503319576576?s=20)
In light of Shaq claiming he would destroy him in his [Instagram post](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eq5m7bGUcAIP7fl?format=jpg&amp;name=large), Rudy Gobert has been getting pretty unnecessary hate from many people on social media, safe to say, he's pretty overhated at the moment as a result of his large contract. I don't think its unreasonable to call him overpaid, but I wouldn't fault a player for accepting that kind of money.","Rudy Gobert responding to the Shaq ""beef"" on Twitter: ""There is no beef. If people wanna keep speaking negatively about me or keep discrediting what i do it’s on them and all that does is show who they are. I will always be happy for a brother beating the odds. And i’m gonna keep beating the odds."""
"Personally I believe Wilt and Bird come in as the next players who could earn this title, with Duncan and Magic slightly behind those 2, but i'm curious to see who your runner ups to the GOAT debate are behind the big 3.","Besides Jordan, Kareem, and Lebron, who do you think has the best case for GOAT?"
"If Raptors decide to tank for a season, who can give the raptors a good package for Lowry? Shams has stated that the market for Lowry is good and raptors can get a good value for him..",Realistic Trade offers for Kyle Lowry?
"Just curious what everyone has to say. Thought this would be a fun little idea for some discussion. Let me know who would you buy and  sell stock in!

I’m a long term Knicks stockholder so I’d definitely be adding more Knicks stock to make up for years of losses!",Let’s say all NBA teams are stocks. What are some teams you’d buy stock in for the next 5 years and some teams you’d sell stock in?
"[Posted this on his IG story about an hour ago.](https://i.imgur.com/JOeQiW7.jpg)

Tob slander permanently cancelled.",Tobias Harris confirmed to at least be aware of r/Sixers
"Jaylen Brown has remarkably improved on his game every season thus far, and it doesn't look like it's gonna stop anytime soon. After playing sub-star level last season and then playing like a star in the playoffs, he seems to have fully established himself as a star in the league this season thus far.

Ben Simmons has barely improved on offense in any meaningful way 4 years in the league, but his defense has improved to a perennial all-defense and fringe DPOY caliber player. Unlikely he improves much on his offense going forward after little improvement in 4 years. 

Who do you think will be regarded as the better player at the end of this season?",Who do you think will be regarded as a better player after this season: Jaylen Brown or Ben Simmons

"In the NBA draft we see a lot of raw, unpolished talent selected high in the draft because they have the potential to get better at the game when they get some experience and NBA training instead of being expected to be a solid contributor from their first season and get better.

In my opinion, some examples of project players in recent drafts are guys like Aleksej Pokusevski, who are expected to become starting caliber players in some years. 

So, according to you, who is a ""project"" who panned out?

Edit: /uBlankVoid2979 explained it better, saying ""A project is someone with high potential but they're very raw and are not very good at the time of the draft"".","Since the year 2000, which draft picks regarded as ""projects"" panned out?"

Going to be another sky fucking night","Curry at the half: 23 points on 7/11 FG, 4/7 from 3, 5/5 from the free throw line"
Just based off experience and knowing what they're capable of doing. They've seen it all in the last 6 years. They have nothing to fear whereas a team like the Clippers have everything to prove. I would not want to play them in the first or second round even if they were a low seed. They have less expectations and less pressure to win but they're gonna bring that same intensity like they do in the past even if they aren't as good. I would treat them the same as if they were still that 73-9 team.  I feel they would have the psychological advantage over most teams. Just the fear of what Curry can do is enough to make you doubt yourself.,Are the Warriors a low key threat if they make the playoffs as a low seed?

"I feel like there hasn't been a nationally televised game on TNT, ESPN or ABC since like Christmas. What's up with that? I don't get NBATV so I've only been able to watch my local team's games, which sucks, and I feel like if I drop $60 for NBATV streaming then all of a sudden all the games I want to watch will be on TNT or ESPN again.",Why no national games outside of NBATV?
"It is not an easy decision due to how much the game has changed and how much guards are expected to score and shoot now. 

Out of these who would you take over Stockton: Dame, Trae, Harden, Luka, Steph, Kyrie, Westbrook.

CP3 is close to stockton's playstile so he is a case of which player you prefer and not which playstyle you prefer.

What is your prefered playstyle for your PG? What traits would you look for in your PG for the modern NBA?","Who would you rather have for your team: Stockton a pass first traditional PG elite on both ends, or a modern day score first PG that might not be as good defensively?"
Thunder lost 2 all stars for Paul George. It seemed like a cradle robbery at the time but now looking back pg left soon and Dipo/Sabonis are all stars. Do the thunder do the same move now? George is the best player of the 3 but 2 all stars &gt; 1.,"If Thunder knew about Sabonis and Dipo development, would it still be a good move to get Paul George?"
"Title pretty much says it all. What moments in NBA history do you feel are under appreciated, whether it be a game, trade, signing, or a stretch of games.

For me it’s Jimmy Butler in the 2020 NBA finals. Particularly games 3 and 5. It was special for me because it wasn’t a product of supernova shooting like Lillard and Harden are one to produce, or spurred on by supreme athletic dominance like Giannis. Hell, even though Jimmy’s a smart player, he wasn’t even outsmarting the other team (ie. LeBron, Jokic, CP3). He was just willing his team to victory in a way I’ve never really seen. It’s cliche, but this is the ultimate example of wanting it most (not that LeBron and the Lakers didn’t want it). It was made all the more powerful by game 6 where it was clear he was a dead man walking. You can even see in the start of this season that he really gave every ounce of himself to win those games.

Also, for a one game example, my favorite underrated game is Kobe dropping 42 in the first half against the Wizards on March 28th, 2003. I was never and still am not exactly a Kobe fan, but it was in my opinion the best half of basketball I’ve ever seen.

Edit: in case it wasn’t clear, it can be recent too, “historical” is honestly just anything before this season.",What are your favorite moments in NBA history that are historically underrated?
"The Spurs still have the narrative of a plodding team, but they played the fastest pace during the bubble.  They are playing uptempo again this year despite playing the majority of their games against some of the slowest in the league (Nola, Utah, LAL twice).

What don't people realize about your team?  I'd like to know the things that the stats, the national broadcaster, or the r/nba frontpage don't tell me.",What specifics of your team are others getting wrong so far this year?
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pokusal01.html. 
  
I know it's harsh to pick on rookies but I'm just hoping to see some answers that can encourage me that this guy won't be a total bust. His body doesn't exactly look NBA ready and the current shooting of 2/21 from the field and 1/16 from three with many misses barely touching the rim is far from promising. I think Jamal Murray started his career 0/16 so that's the best answer to the question I can think of but are there anymore?",[Serious] What are the worst starts to an NBA career in a players first 5 games? Currently Aleksej Pokusevski has recorded 10 turnovers and 5 points on 9/6/- shooting splits in 80 minutes.
Do you y'all think it's fair to compare Zach Lavine to Prime Carter? Same player build and archetype.,Zach Lavine comparable to Vince Carter?
"As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%).

McCollum has made 28-65 of his shots beyond the arc while Nurkic has been 6-14 from the line. 

https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers","As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%)."
"That's all.

You want more? Terrence Davis is on the outs with the Raptors anyway right? Or better yet, Kyle Lowry could keep them in the playoffs. Meanwhile the Raptors could stand to get rid of one of those two. Not like they're competing this year anyway.","Orlando Magic should trade for Kyle Lowry or Terrence Davis, and Raptors should blow it up."
"I'm just watching the Hawks struggling to score 10 points in a quarter right now and they are actually pathetic. No flow offensively and giving up offensive rebounds for fun. The team has lost to the Cavs, Knicks and should lose comfortably to the Hornets. Just like last season, they are the ultimate pretenders after 3-4 games and will struggle to win 25 games again.  

As for Bogdanovic, the less said about him the better. The Bucks absolutely dodged a bullet. I will give him time to adjust but the guy looks nowhere near a 20m/year player",The Hawks are nowhere near a playoff team and Bogdanovic might be the most overrated free agent signing of the off-season.
"
Draymond Green 4/6/6 on 33/0/66 shooting and tied for a game worst -11 in 31 minutes tonight. The backpack has yet to be unhitched as Draymond Green continues to struggle to be able to score

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267276",Draymond Green 4/6/6 on 33/0/66 shooting and tied for a game worst -11 in 31 minutes tonight
Whenever I see threads on this subreddut or even articles from ESPN about the best Eastern team at a shot to win the chip it feels like the pacers are almost never mentioned. The starting 5 seems so balanced and with how Sabonis and Oladipo are playing it seems like they could potentially have 2 all star players.  I feel like the team doesn't have a glaring weakness that some of the other contending east teams do.,Are the Pacers the most underrated team in the east?

"Anybody know the rules surrounding the play in tournament and the lottery?

If you make it to the play in as a 9th or 10th seed, win, then reach the playoffs, are you out of the lottery selection? Do you stay at your previous standings position but are just not included in the drawing? Or do you stay locked into both no matter what happens?

"I thought it from the beginning of season, but after tonight even in the loss it's confirmed. Bradley, we know what he brings playmaker, creative, aggressive scorer, lou will on roids and clutch. Combined with westbrook aggressive, great passer, draws in defenses for the kick outs; Also decent perimeter D. Name a better back court, cp3 and book? Close but no cigar.",Washington has best back court in nba

"George hill, imo, is the most obvious and likely player who will be traded at the trade deadline this season.
The thunder are clearly in rebuild mode and are in asset accumulation mode and we know how much Presti loves his draft picks.

Hill should be of interest to most contenders because of what he brings to the table as a player, locker room vet, and his contract is great.

Hill’s contract: This season George Hill will make a fully guaranteed  9.5 million dollars which is a good price. However next season Hill is making 10 million dollars with only 1 million guaranteed so if a team doesn’t like his performance, they can waive him without taking a big cap hit. 

Hill as a player: George Hill is known for being an elite shooter and a solid defender. Last season with the Bucks he led the league in 3pt shooting as he shot 46% from deep. This season, he is shooting 43% from 3 which is still great. 
Hill isn’t the best playmaker but he isn’t bad by any means as he’s averaged over 3 assists in the past couple of season while playing under 25 min a game.


I think Hill could help the Nets now that Dinwiddie is out. 
If the Clippers want to move on from Lou Williams, then Hill would be a great replacement.
The Celtics could also use George Hill.

Ultimately, these teams would probably have to add draft capital to entice OKC.

"At this point I think it should be accepted that second round pick Nikola Jokic is both the best passing center we’ve ever seen, as well as one of the greatest offensive centerpieces in the game today. His skill set is mesmerizing, blending skill size and intelligence which has already been shown to elevate in the playoffs. Early on in the season, this dude is averaging 22 points, 11 rebounds, and almost 13 assists. Stats on this level are unsustainable, and the season is young, but does he have a legit shot at being the third player ever to average a triple double over the course of a season? 

The first direction in answering this has to be looking at Westbrook’s run from 2017 until the end of his Thunder tenure. Denver’s performance as a team will likely be one of the biggest factors in wether or not Jokic can accomplish this feat. The limitations of the post Durant-Thunder roster called for Westbrook’s direct involvement every trip down the floor. Not only was he allowed to dominate the ball... they needed him to. Denver’s roster is much better, and they have a legitimate co-star for Jokic who will have the ball in his hands a lot throughout the season, but we’ve already seen the Nuggets heavily lean on their superstar center to start the year. Additionally, if we can be honest with ourselves, Westbrook’s personality surely played a role in this statistical feat, and I don’t think Jokic will care about his stats enough to hunt them out as the season goes down the stretch. With that said, Jokics passing is always in such a flow within the offense, it may not be such a challenge for him.

Look, do I think it will happen, probably not. But I swear I have never seen someone like this guy play basketball. He’s fucking different, and I think an MVP season could be in the cards regardless. Jokic certainly has a chance to make some history in his career, and honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a part of it.",Jokic on triple double watch for the season?
Disastrous offseason for the jazz overpaying 2 borderline all stars to massive deals. The organization will be hamstrung for a long time with these massive deals. What can the jazz do to get out of these awful contracts? Maybe they can give picks to okc and dump these contracts,The jazz are paying donovan mitchell over 30 million a year and he’s shooting 38% from the field
"It feels like cp3 can do anything on a basketball court, from running the PNR, having a money midrange game, deadeye passer, high assist to turnover ratio, and very vocal as well. Also, his defensive instincts are insane, for a guy of his height to guard legit wings/guards in this league in the post is absurb.. who else do you guys feel are underrated in terms of having a complete arsenal?",Is Cp3 underrated in terms of having a complete arsenal both offensively and on defense?
Just seen an article saying something along the lines of James Harden ball hogging and being selfish like A.I was. I'm too young to have had the pleasure of watching Allen Iverson play so I was just wondering if there was truth to that comment?? Was AI a selfish player?,Was A.I a selfish player?
Let's say the offensive team tries to dunk the ball but blows it massively. The ball touches nobody on either side and reaches the backcourt. Can the offensive team grab that ball because it hit the rim?,Is it a backcourt violation if the ball hits the rim but nobody touches it until it reaches the back court?

"The Knicks are currently the 11th best defense by defensive rating, but teams are shooting an unsustainably low 29.5% from three against them. There are a lot of smart people who believe that defenses can't affect how 3 point shooters shoot, there are also a lot of smart people who believe that smart teams know which threes to give up, or contest better. The Celtics, i think, had a low defensive 3pt% for years. 

Nevertheless, here's how teams would look assuming teams shot league average 3pt percentage against them. The formula is taking (Defensive 3pt% - Average 3 pt%)\*(Defensive 3pt attempt rate)\*(100) to get the D rating adjustment. All the data is taken from basketball reference.

EDIT: (A nice little add on to this post). Look through this gettyimages gallery of the time. Knicks, Spurs, Bulls players..celebrities court side. Really just a different time. Definitely worth a quick look through.

Wade and Dirk spend their last years in their home team in the same season.

"I think it was Harden's coach last year talking about it. I'm assuming this is like points per possession and Harden's free throw shooting makes him the most efficient of all time?

EDIT: So I remember the coach saying that if you give Jordan and Harden the ball who produces the most points before you give it up.

I'm firmly a Harden hater don't worry about it I just want to understand what the argument is about.

EDITEDIT: So Harden has a higher eFG for many seasons but I'm not sure that was what was being referenced. And my understanding is the weighting changes the figures so it's era dependant(when you account free throws into the equation), but I'm not very knowledgable so...

EDITEDITEDIT: Another I found as I'm learning to use the stat sites is per 100 possessions Harden's highest is 2019 season 48 to Jordan's 46. And TS% .672 to Jordan's .614. It's probably one of these I was looking for.

Unlike MVP/Finals MVP, it actually takes into account the whole season. So I feel it is more grounded in reality when it comes to judging who the best player in the world is. Unfortunately it only dates to 1993, so certain Michael Jordan seasons, Kareem's entire career, and many others all time greats missed out on the opportunity to receive one. Still, I think I personally prefer this award's objectivity over the MVP. I was amazed to find it was so obscure/little talked about.

"A very solid game for Harris in the 76ers blowout versus the hornets, leading the team in scoring by a healthy margin. 22 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists and very efficient from the field (10/16), although he hasn't taken a single free throw the entire game. This is his 4th straight 20 point game, all four games shooting over 50%. He is proving to be a reliable scoring option under his favorite coach, Doc Rivers, as the Sixers improve to a league-best 6-1 record. It is also worth noting that the Sixers had 34 assists on 46 made field goals- great ball movement shown tonight.  
  
I know that this would be an average game for any star in the league (and it is vs the Hornets), but it's worth noting how consistent Tobias has been, and he's finally proving doubters wrong.

"With the competitive instinct he had as a player he has squandered the Hornets ever since he owned them. Been comfortable sitting around 7th or 8th or just outside the playoffs. The Hornets contracts have been crazy. Overpaying guys like Batum and low balling Kemba. Their coaches are always poor or jmediocre. Whenever they sign ""big names"" it's usually guys way past their prime like Tony Parker or Dwight. Kemba was the only all star they've drafted in last ten years since Jordan has owned the team.

I know Jordan was bitching a few years back when it was Warriors vs Cavs every year in the finals for awhile that the NBA made it to hard on small market teams because of all these other teams scooping up all the big names to create superteams. Maybe it's a lack of money causing him to fail the Hornets? Seems like he should be trying harder than he has because of his ""do anything to win"" mentality from the past.",Why do you think Jordan hasn't been competitive as an owner like he was as a player?
"I know it’s really early in the season but my top 3 surprises are Keldon Johnson, Sabonis, and Christian Wood (Tobi as an honorable mention). I expected all 3 to be good, just not like this.

&gt;""Honestly it's just being able to play my game, not being totally set on it's gotta be this, this or this, and it's kinda been the system I have kinda been playing in for awhile. It's gotta be threes layups or free throws. It's not like that over here. They play to their style of everybody's game, and we're not looking at anyone like you got to do this, you got to do that man, we play basketball over here""

&gt;It's a free-flowing game, nobody tries to go outside of themself, and I think that's what the best thing is about being over here on this team and being with these guys because everybody does what they already do well, nobody try to go out there and prove they do something that people haven't seen""

"Curry finished the game with 5 rebounds and 4 assists as well.

It was refreshing to see Steph back in form. His energy is unlike anyone else's in the league that we've ever seen. 

Unfortunately it seems like this is what the Warriors will need every night in order to win a significant number of games.  Wish Klay was healthy to see what they could do together.",Steph Curry scores a career-high 62 points on 18-31 shooting and 8-16 from 3.
It’s still early but who are some players you could see being traded as soon as the eligibility period begins. Who are some players that jump out at you as being destined to be traded as soon as possible?,Early Trade Candidates?
"At the time of the trade everyone clowned the Sixers for giving up Fultz and only getting Jonathan Simmons and a “fake first rounder” in return. Flash forward to 2021 and that fake first has turned into Tyrese Maxey. Maxes not only a promising prospect but he has been giving the Sixers meaningful minutes already. His stats have not been overly impressive but he’s looked great as a primary ball handler with the bench unit, can create his own offense and is an active defender. Meanwhile Fultz has become even more inefficient than he was in Philly. He’s also making $20m a year for 4 years while Maxey only makes 3/4.  Sixers won the trade",Did the Sixers win the Fultz trade with Orlando?

Young is averaging 28.2 ppg and 10.7 of those are coming from free throws that he intentionally draws. Steve Nash criticized it saying it was not how you play basketball. He’s obviously not the only one to do this (cough cough Harden) but he seems to have done it the most this season. How can the league prevent players from doing this? Should the NBA call less fouls but increase the potency of a flagrant?,Trae Young’s offensive tactics. How can we prevent this?

"Solid start to the season for Cam. Feels like people forget how highly he was rated coming out of high school. It was the right decision by Atlanta to keep him in a starting role despite their off-season additions. Still only 21-years old as well, he's got a bright future ahead of him.

"Tim Duncan made a rare podcast appearance on the Real Ones Podcast released today. This is I think his second one after the Road Trippin' Podcast 3 years ago.

In the pod, he also talked about who he modeled his game after, his relationship with Coach Pop, his battles with KG, Dirk and Kobe, player empowerment, his most fulfilling championship (spoiler: 2005 versus the Pistons), his brief coaching stint on the Spurs, and more.

Jokic part is at 58:08

I feel like no one talks about this guy. Hes one of the most underrated role players in the league IMO. Crazy athleticism, good skillset on offense from scoring, rolling, lob threat, offensive glass and passing, very mobile defensive big that can switch on most players. Hed fit great on basically any team. Hes actually leading the league in steals so far in this young season","Larry Nance perfect game: 18/4/3/3 (7/7 FG, 4/4 3PT)"
"Damian Lillard finishes tonight's Blazers blowout of the Timberwolves with 39 points, 7 asts, 7 rebs, shooting 13/21 and 7/13 from downtown

Damian Lillard hit some deep, deep shots tonight. Dude is an absolute killer. Yes, it helps that the Wolves defense was at times non existent but the man was puling up from 35-40 feet no problem.","Damian Lillard finishes tonight's Blazers blowout of the Timberwolves with 39 points, 7 asts, 7 rebs, shooting 13/21 and 7/13 from downtown"
"Throughout his first 5 games of this season, Griffin did these:

0 Offensive Boards, 0 Blocks, 0 Dunks, 0 And1. He attempted 65% of his shots behind the 3pt line and only 13.3% of his attempts were from 0-3ft area. His average shot distance this season is... 19.1ft. It's almost high as JJ Redick's career number. 

It's painfully clear that his days of an athletic freak is more than just 'gone'. He just strolls through the court like AI after his retirement. Of course, Griffin is still a savvy guy for his size, at least. Decent shooter with some great handles and playmaking ablilities. Despite his limits, he somehow manages to get 14.2 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 3.6 APG with not-that-dreadful efficiency.

One of the most amusing things about watching San Antonio Spurs games to me is watching their coach Gregg Popovich on the sidelines. Somehow, he has not lost his competitive fire at all at age 71 and he remains as spirited as ever toward the refs and his own players. Whenever the cameras cut to him “going Serbian” (in his own words) I’m always curious about what gets him so ticked off. Usually, this is extremely difficult to decipher in the moment. When I watched him fly off the handle late in the 1/5/2021 game between the Spurs and the LA Clippers, I decided to look back at a few plays down the stretch of that game and try to get to the bottom of what had him so angry.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 1

https://streamable.com/mqkme3

In this first clip, Keldon Johnson (no. 3) messes up a switch and doesn’t get to his man (Luke Kennard, no. 5) in time, leading to an open jumper. Although the play does end up in a Clippers turnover after Kennard misses the shot, Pop strikes me more of a process than a results guy and I’m sure defensive execution is something he drills on a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 2

https://streamable.com/rtquxz

The next frustrating breakdown I saw was with about 2:40 left in the 4th, when Lou Williams (no. 23) blows by Johnson for a layup easily with his speed advantage. Demar Derozan (no. 10) is there with the help, but he is a step late and Williams is such a great finisher that there’s not much Derozan can do. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 3

https://streamable.com/npkwyp

The very next play, Johnson and Patty Mills (no. 8) mess up a defensive coverage on the pick and roll and this leads to an open 3 point basket. When Lou Williams sets a ball screen for Kawhi Leonard (no. 2, Johnson’s man), Patty Mills begins guarding Leonard since he thinks the two are supposed to switch the players they are guarding. However, Johnson fights over the screen and stays with Leonard also, leading to Williams popping to the top of the key and nailing the shot. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 4

https://streamable.com/9363l1

The next defensive possession for the Spurs, Patrick Beverley uses a drag screen from Kawhi Leonard to drive the ball to the hoop and pick up a layup. In this play, Johnson stays with the ball handler (Beverley), but floats a little bit too far to the right, giving Beverley an easy lane to the rim. Johnson’s positioning is probably fine in terms of depth, since at this point in the game Beverley had canned SIX 3-pointers and the Spurs might not have wanted Beverley to raise up and shoot the ball as he came off of the screen. However, Johnson should have been able to slow Beverley down enough for help to come. Thus, you notice that he does not drop back to explicitly take away the layup in favor of offering a 3-pointer, but goes up to the level of the screen to run Beverley off of the 3-point line. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Pop reaches the end of his rope

https://streamable.com/5x4h14

I slowed down the clip to try to read Pop’s lips as the camera catches him speaking to the players here. I think he’s saying “HEY! Can you guard somebody?” directed at either Gay, Derozan, or Mills, since Johnson is on the other side of the court.

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/svkuo0


With 5.7 seconds left, Patty Mills had two free throws to ice the game but the Clippers insisted on a replay review instants before Mills was about to shoot his first free throw in an attempt to “ice” him. Basically, the strategy is to make Mills think about the free throw more and psychologically influence him to miss it, a strategy which has been debunked before. When the refs decide to stop and review, you can hear a voice (probably Pop) yelling in the background, “THAT’S BULLS--T”. To be quite honest, Pop is not wrong since I believe the rulebook states that replays must be executed before the foul shooter sets foot on the free throw line. 

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/536dkr


At this point, Pop’s rage knows no bounds and the cameras show his next victim to be Keldon Johnson. I’ve slowed down the clip below, and it appears Pop says, “Oh, is that what you’re saying? Huh? HUH?” possibly dismissing Johnson’s attempts to defend himself. 

&amp;nbsp;

"The Denver Nuggets HAD been the brightest team with the best looking future in the NBA. This season, they are obviously off to a bad start, going 3-5 after losing to the mavericks. I believe that the two main reasons for this are the departure of Jerami Grant, but the horrendous coaching from Michael Malone. 


Malone has beet trying and forcing a 4 guard lineup, ultra small ball. These lineups have not been working at all, only hurting the team. The opposing team almost always goes on long runs against these 4 guard lineups. Also, rebounding has been a massive problem all season. How do we fix this? By putting 4 guards out on the floor, according to Malone. 


Jerami Grant decided to move to Detroit, wanting to become a larger part of the offense. He was an excellent wing defender, along with Torrey Craig, another wing who left the Nuggets. The Nuggets have repeatedly been getting pounded from deep, and it seems like opposing teams go 50% from downtown due to the lack of good wing defense. The front office replaces these players by signing 2 undersized point guards, leaving the team with 5 point guards. That's 1/3 of the entire roster, point guards.


Because of this, I don't see the Nuggets presenting a challenge to any of the top 4 teams in the west, an utter waste of the superstar talent the team has in Jokic, Murray, and Michael Porter Jr. I see the Nuggets landing at 5th or 6th seed unless there is a significant turnaround.",The Denver Nuggets' disappointing start to the season.

"As most people know, the current league protocol is if a player has been in contact with someone who had it, they have to isolate for 7 days at minimum (even if they have had the virus before you can get reinfected but the evidence suggests it isn't very common). You also can't get reinstated even if you have multiple negative tests in the following days. 

Obviously this makes sense to protect the other players but this has always seemed odd to me because in order to be consistent in a situation like the one with seth curry, you now have to cancel all of the sixers games for a week as the whole team has been exposed (the wizards too).

Allowing the sixer games to continue also creates the very bad precedent that it's better to have your whole team get exposed and hope no one gets it than just having one star player.

"1. They get drafted to the LA Lakers one year apart as high lottery picks. 

2. They play together on a rebuilding Lakers team, do relatively well but not exactly as good as they were hyped up to be. 

3. Both gotten rid of in replaced with a new more popular player of their position and a somewhat similar play-stye (LeBron and Lonzo) 

4. Both find their way on to a thought to be bad New York team (Nets and Knicks) and out preform and drastically improve as players becoming the surprising new leader of the team. 

5. The team out preforms expectations and 
become the new exciting fun team to watch with a new culture (with the help of new coaches (Kenny and Thibs) 

Only difference is D-Lo gets traded and the Nets acquire starpower from D-Lo (possibly what’s next for Knicks?)",The careers of Julius Randle and D’angelo Russell are eerily similar...

While Jokic isn't the best regular season performer (although this season he may prove us wrong), he always step's his game up in the playoffs. In only his second year, he made it to the conference finals, only losing to the eventual champs. Will Jokic be as good as the players I've listed here? Not super likely. Is he showing potential to be one of the best playoff performers of this era? I think yes.",[OC] Jokic's playoff stats vs HOFer's first 2 years in the playoffs
"Famed point center Bismack Biyombo has started the last seven games due to a Cody Zeller injury, and averaged 3.0 assists per game, after recording zero coming off the bench on opening night. He has recorded 21 assists in these games.

Over this same stretch, Terry Rozier, who was once seen as a point guard for some reason, has recorded 20 assists, 2.9apg.

Felt this was a stat that needed to be known by more people. Do what you like with this information.

"[Article](https://sports.yahoo.com/los-angeles-clippers-all-star-paul-george-mental-health-struggles-nba-190030411.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKYQKkV6MaMHNqVbFeSbfKHkG7z-dq_LKXTrBJKfoMFwYNUKZYm2sWa_5T7xcc3RPYRA8qfs83KIepQGR18V8JgpzsfTkfMRsFbv-7sO0r21keYMElO-2IXPWYTZcjsFEzU0BlfgEZ-nl6Ykww0LmuXn2xP4opuRrsrNS-tfd0uG)

There has to be a question of Paul George's new reputation as 'soft' is due to his openness about mental health, which this article brings up.

Paul George doesn't know where it's coming from: 
&gt; Last year was last year. I'm in a new situation; I am in a different mindset. Any of that hate stuff, you got to ask them. I don't know where that's coming from. 

Ben Rohrbach in the article directly blames this new hate on Paul George's openness about mental health.
&gt; Was George “soft” when he rebuilt himself into an MVP candidate after suffering one of the most brutal leg injuries the game has ever seen in 2014? No. Was he “soft” for taking umbrage when Cameron Payne wildly jumped on that same leg after the whistle was already blown, sparking Booker’s outburst on Sunday? No.

&gt; We all know why Booker said what he said. Except, George is not “soft” for having the courage to share publicly what others in the NBA would not. He is stronger. Mental health struggles are real, especially during the pandemic, and professional athletes are not immune. Paul himself called this his top priority as the National Basketball Players Association president over the summer. His lines on the court might be blurrier.&gt;","[Rohrbach] Paul George is back on top because he shared his mental health struggles, not in spite of them"
"So this is more about fit then anything. You want to build a team that can try to win this season. I’m gonna give you some options, use them to create a 8 man rotation(or just a starting 5 if you’re lazy). Just follow the directions and you’ll get your team.

If you did all of those you should have a total of 8 players. How is the team you just made. Who are your starters and bench guys? Is your team capable of winning a finals in today’s nba?",Follow the guideline to create the best team you can. Why did you pick who you did and how do they fit together?
I know Josh Hart plays warzone. He talks about it quite often on Twitter. Also didn’t bron play football in hs? Just interested to hear this tbh.,Best gamer/multi sports athletes in the NBA?
"I haven't.

One of the minor talking points in the bubble was that players now have a lot more space under the basket and don't have to worry about falling into clunky cameras and tweaking an ankle. I thought I would have noticed the absence of those specific camera angles, but I nearly forgot about them. The main angles they would provide are the baseline angles (used sparingly) and for halftime/post game interviews .

I think we should do away with that angle permanently and have the cameraman needed for interviews sit elsewhere.","Between the bubble and the start of this season, have you noticed the lack of baseline cameramen in terms of the camera angle they provide?"

It seems like there has been a lot less ref complaining so far this season than usual. In seasons past, I swear every post game thread was complaining about the officiating. This season, and maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like I see a lot less of it.","Have the refs gotten better, or are we all just complaining out them less?"
"He also had a block and 3 steals, one of which basically iced the game. He was 7/15 from the floor and 3/7 from 3, with all of this threes coming in the fourth quarter. He did this all without De'Aaron Fox.

|^[boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com](https://boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com/) ^by ^/u/bazman1976 ^(original work by /u/Obi-Wan_Ginobili)|",[Post Game Thread] The Boston Celtics (6-3) defeat the Miami Heat (3-4) 107-105 off the Payton Pritchard putback game winner
"He started the game 0-6 from the field, then went absolutely nuclear. He had two and-ones and a crucial block on Bradley Beal (who was incredible, scoring 60 points) down the stretch.

Embiid's performance was just enough to eke out a 141-136 win, keep the home winning streak alive and propel the Sixers to an NBA-best 7-1.

edit: 38 points, not 37 (that's 63% of a Bradley Beal!)","Joel Embiid: 37 pts on 11-20 FG, 3-4 3PT, 13-13 FT. Also added 8 reb, 5 ast, 3 stl, 3 blk"
"Timberwolves fans told everybody that Jimmy Butler and Thibs were the problem.    

Last year Jimmy proved them wrong by being the guy to lead his team to the finals.    

Now Thibs is proving he is still a great coach.        

Meanwhile the Timberwolves still suck.      

IDK maybe the problem is KAT?",How bad does it look that both Jimmy Butler and Thibs are succeeding after being run out of Minnesota?
"I was bored and decided to look up what he was up to now with the Pistons, and as it turns out he's giving them a solid 15/4 in 20 minutes a night. Pretty good for someone who spent the majority of last season in the G-League with his career looking like it was gonna go by the wayside. 

Is this just another product of good numbers on a bad team, or is Josh Jackson = future all star back on the menu?",Is Josh Jackson's resurgence for real?
"It seems like literally all of the coaches hate doing it and they usually give non-answers anyway, so what’s the point of doing the interviews at all?",What are your opinions on the mid-game coach interviews?
Austin Rivers has hit some clutch shots in the previous 2 games including a dominating performance in the 4th quarter tonight. 3 years/10 million seems like a steal so far.,Austin Rivers in the Knicks win tonight vs the Jazz: 23 pts/3 rebs/2 asts on 9/14 FG (5/7 3pt) including 14 consecutive points for the Knicks late in the 4th
"Here are some guys who I think deserve a little more love, even if none of them are necessarily not liked

George Hill: An extremely steady, calm, two way point guard. I love how he literally never plays outside his comfort zone, seems like a good leader, and appreciate the work he's put into his three point jumper. 

Lowry: When people talk about the ""desire to win"", I think Lowry embodies that as much as one can. Dude is literally always finding some way to impact the game if he has the ball or doesn't. Defensively he's obviously a master charge taker, and sturdy post defender. Offensively you can trust he'll end up doing something valuable with the ball. Whether it's getting to the line, hitting a three, or finding a teammate. He does have the tendency to flop, but overall, such a joy 

Redick/Korver: Just absolute professionals who have put a ridiculous amount of work towards perfecting one skill: Shooting the ball. A shit ton of repetition and practice to become near all star level players despite lacking impressive physical tools. 

Josh Hart: My favorite player by far, the reason being that his entire game is literally effort based. Hart has genuinely below average talent. He's not a skilled ball handler, not super athletic, and doesn't have a good shooting stroke, or high court vision. The only reason at all he's a serviceable player is because he tries really freaking hard on the defensive end, bodying up bigger guys and securing rebounds like few others guards in NBA history. Even then he sometimes gets lost on defense. He basically is an example of how far 100 % effort in NBA games can get you",Under-appreciated players!
Not including the injured players obviously. But there are a few names that come to my mind immediately. What do you think?,What player do you think has regressed the most this season from last? So far anyway

He looked the best he has since the shutdown although Toronto took another L in their schedule. However if Siakam can get his shit together the Raptors might be able to follow suit. Let's see if he can continue the improved performance after his struggles since last year,"Pascal Siakam comes alive despite another loss: 32 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists on 11/21 shooting"
"When Trae Young doesn't get 15+ free throw attempts off BS foul calls, he struggles. His 3pt shot has been off all season (shooting only 33%) and without the FTs to rely on, Young struggled all night as the Hawks lose to the Hornets","Trae Young tonight: 7 points/5 rebounds/3 assists/7 turnovers on 2/9 FG, 0/3 3pt/, 3/3 FT in 35min"
"Since 2011, 40% of first overall picks were named Anthony (including Karl-Anthony). It is quite amazing how one name can be connected to such a coveted draft position. While we are yet to see how all of their careers will turn out, it seems there are some definite perks to having the moniker. In the grand scheme of things it's astounding to think that around 5.5% of all number one picks have been bestowed the same first name. This thought came to me out of the blue, but let me know if y'all have any theories......",Does Being Named Anthony Increase the Chance You're the 1st Overall Pick?

"I was just thinking how all the recent mvps led their team in win shares. And as I was looking through stats I saw Khris Middleton was the Bucks leader. If this kept up, and hypothetically if the bucks went 72-0, Giannis would most likely win MVP, but Middleton would be the leader in win shares. Because popularity etc etc.

Had such a case ever happened before, where the mvp didn’t lead their team in win shares?",Had there ever been an MVP who didn’t lead their team in win shares?
"We are just a few weeks into this NBA season, what is your boldest take? Before the year started, I said Bradley Beal would be 1st Team All-NBA... probably not going to happen but it was bold.",What is your boldest NBA take for this season?
"How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?  


**Actual Standings:**  


East:  


1. 76ers
2. Magic
3. Pacers
4. Celtics
5. Knicks
6. Bucks
7. Cavs Nets

West:

1. Suns
2. Lakers
3. Clippers
4. Jazz
5. Pelicans
6. Warriors
7. Kings
8. Blazers

Here was my predictions for the standings before the start of the season (bracket number is where how far that are in reality vs where I predicted them as of January 6th 2020):

**My predictions:**  
East:

1. Nets ( -7)
2. Bucks ( - 4)
3. Celtics ( - 1)
4. Heat ( -7)
5. 76ers ( +3)
6. Raptors ( -7)
7. Wizards ( - 5)
8. Pacers ( +5)

West:

1. Lakers ( -1)
2. Nuggets ( -10)
3. Mavs ( -6)
4. Clippers ( +1)
5. Jazz ( +1)
6. Warriors ( 0)
7. Rockets ( -6)
8. Suns (+7)
9. Blazers - toss up between 8/9 (+1)

1/10th of the season through, most of these picks look horrible.

I made these predictions an hour before the first game of the season. Let me know if you're curious for some of my picks or what your own picks were. For instance, for the Rockets I made the assumption that James Harden wouldn't play for the Rockets again and would be traded for some decent pieces (I was wrong).",How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?
"I suspect I'm over-thinking this, but I dislike the term 'small ball' because playing small is not the point. It's caught on because it rhymes and is relatively easy for people to picture: More small players, fewer big players.  But it's not about being small for smallness's sake, because if a team could play five big, fast, skilled, switchable guys who were all 7 feet tall, then that's what teams would do. A line-up of five Kevin Durants would be amazing. 

The point of what's commonly called 'small ball' can vary, but it's usually some variation or combination of the following:

* speed ball - fast, up-tempo play
* skill (or versatile) ball - multiple ball handlers, playmakers, shooters who can present many offensive looks
* switchable ball - similar to the previous item, but more of a defensive focus on guys who can switch without compromising match-ups

If you could rebrand 'small ball' then what would you call it instead?",What's a more accurate term for 'small ball'?
"The NBA credited Lamelo Ball with a 3 pointer with 2:12 seconds left in the 3rd quarter that was actually hit by Devonte' Graham. Here is the quote from the box score and here's a picture curtesy of a redditor below: [https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9](https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9)

"" **2:12 LaMelo Ball makes 24-foot three point jumper (P.J. Washington assists) 77-64 ""**

This shot can clearly be seen just after the 7:00 mark of the video highlights from the game (posted literally by the NBA): [https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422](https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422)

Devonte' Graham made the shot - NOT Lamelo Ball.

Is the NBA trying to inflate the stats of Lamelo Ball? Or did Vegas do this somehow as the over/under for Graham was set at 11.5 and this shot would have made the over hit?

TL;DR: Graham scored 14 points this game but was only credited with 11 after this 3 was given to Ball instead of him.",Devonte' Graham had his 3 pointer incorrectly credited to Lamelo Ball
"“ Bradley Beal (4) has passed Gilbert Arenas (3) for most 50-point games in Wizards franchise history. Beal has 57 points after 3 quarters.”

Beal is on fire this game. 57 (19-29FG) points through 3 quarters vs the 76ers.

"Another thing the player shouldn’t be a second option. You can only name a player who was the first option. 



P.s. I honestly would go with lamarcus aldrige even thou in his best season from scoring perspective was only 23ppg i think he is still one of the best in this category.",Who are the besr scorers in nba history to never average more than 25 ppg in a season?

"I think the Lakers are in a tier of their own, and the Clippers are in a tier of their own below the Lakers. 

It's impossible to predict if Harden decides to buy in with Houston or if a trade will go through. And I don't have faith in NOLA if Zion doesn't start playing defense and if SVG doesn't figure out how to maximize his players instead of running Ingram hero ball down the stretch.

So other than LA, I think these are the six teams likely to make the Western playoffs. All of them except the Suns have proven they can make the playoffs with their current core and coach. And CP3 has better teammates on the Suns than he did on the Thunder, so with their hot start showing things are working it's hard to think they'll miss the postseason. 

So how do you rank these six Western teams? I'd say Nuggets, Jazz, Suns, Mavericks, Warriors, Blazers.","Rank the following Western playoff teams: Suns, Jazz, Nuggets, Blazers, Mavericks, Warriors."
There shouldn't be a question at all that he is an All-Star this year. Dude has been absolutely on fire and is by far the floor general for the Pacers.,"Malcolm Brogdon career high with 35 points, on 13/25 FG, 4/6 3PT, and 7 assists."

What game has been the best game this year? I feel like there hasn't really been a game that stands out from the rest. The best game I can think of was bucks vs celtics but that might just be because I'm a Celtics fan. Wizards vs nets was good too,Best game of the year so far

"Hey y'all, pretty hectic day in the US yesterday so it may have been pretty easy to miss what went on in the Association last night, rest assured I have got you covered. Lots lots lots went on in the NBA last night and I really tried to get you guys the scoop here, let's get into it.(Note this is generally tailored for NBA Fantasy players, but still something all NBA fans would enjoy)

&amp;#x200B;

Nightly Notables

&amp;#x200B;

* Markelle Fultz goes down with a torn ACL
   * Extremely devastating new for Fultz and the Magic. Fultz was averaging career highs in nearly all of his stats and this crucially hurts his development as a player. 
   * I can not stress this enough, but if Cole Anthony is available, add him ASAP. He filled in for Fultz and played a career high 32 minutes. Anthony is a very talented rookie and it will be interesting to see how he fares as the lead point guard for his squad

&amp;#x200B;

* Bradley Beal Drops Career High 60 in the L to Embiid's 38
   * Wow were the stars shining in this one, fitting that the game with no defense yesterday featured a team from Washington playing in it. Beal exploded for 57 points in three quarters, but only scored three more the rest of the game as the 76ers took over late and were able to contain him a bit. Beal's final line was 60 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists
   * Embiid on the other side of the court scored 38 points on 11/20 shooting and 13/13 from the stripe to go along with 8 boards and 5 assists. Embiid's Sixers are off to a sizzling hot NBA best 7-1 start and I think it is only fair for the MVP Embiid talks to start brewing up a bit. 
   * Also want to note that Simmons and Westbrook were their usual triple double threat side-kicks with a 17/6/12 line for Simmons and 20/8/12 line for Westbrook. They continue to prove their worth as daily top options at the PG spot.

&amp;#x200B;

* Hayward, Grant, Brogdon, and White all decide to drop career highs too
   * Gordon Hayward looked awesome against the Hawks pouring in 44 points and hitting some tough shots all game long. It is great to really see Hayward fully healthy and really looking aggressive and confident. It will be interesting to see if he can build upon this explosion
   * Jerami Grant has been terrific early on for the Pistons and although they took the L to Giannis and the Bucks, Grant still dropped 31 points and grabbed 10 boards to go along. Grant has really rewarded those who drafted him in their leagues and seems to have the green light to shoot whatever he wants for Detroit. 
   * Malcom Brogdon dropped 35 points on the Rockets on 13/25 from the field and 4/6 from beyond the arc. Brogdon has been playing at a high level this whole season and Warren's injury has elevated his game even further as he is averaging 26.5 PPG since Warren went down. Brogdon is turning into an elite option at PG for fantasy owners and is really stepping up his game this season
   * Coby White looked incredible in the loss vs the Kings, putting up a new career high with 36 points in 39 minutes. White is starting to find some more consistency as the season progresses with his third straight 20+ game, but he probably won't be playing nearly 40 minutes a game when Sato returns to the lineup

&amp;#x200B;

* Most Improved Randle?
   * Julius Randles has been to simply put it incredible to start the new season. He continued his great play with a 30 points, 16 board, 7 assist outing in a come back win vs the Jazz to lead the Knicks to a 5-3 record this early season. Randle has become a nightly triple threat type of player and after being skeptical at first, it really is looking like Randle might actually be a star player in this league 
   * Also want to point out, Thibs is back to being Thibs, nearly all of his starters played 30+ minutes and Randle, Payton, and Robinson all were either close to or over 40 minutes.  Also important to note Rivers has seen back to back 30+ minute games and is solidifying a role in his rotation, while Quickley saw just 5 minutes. Rivers played great last night in the clutch and had 23 points off the bench for NYK. I would not give up on Quickley entirely as the prior game Thibs trusted him down the stretch. Definitely a situation to monitor. I am curious what happens when Burks returns

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Wall Shines again as Harden struggles with his shot 
   * John Wall impresses again with an efficient 28 points on 12/20 shooting to go along with 6 rebounds and 3 assists in 37 minutes. Wall is back to looking like his healthy, speedy, dynamic self that we saw what feels like ages ago in Washington. He is really looking like a legit top option at the point guard position
   * Harden on the other hand ""only"" scored 15 points on 5/14 shooting and 1/5 from three, although he was in his playmaking mode with 12 assists. His past two games he's gone 10/31 from the field and 4/16 from three. Would not be too concerned about Harden obviously as we all know how talented he is, but I think there could be some reason to believe his points might dip from what we are used to due to the talent on this team with Wall+Woods+Cousins. Again would not be worried much with Harden though as he is one of the best scorers of all time and he has had immensive amount of success with talent around him before, but just some quick knee-jerk reaction here and maybe even could be a time to try and buy him low.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Raptors continue to struggle while the Suns continue to impress 
   * Devin Booker lead the Suns in a balanced attack over with 24 points, Deandre Ayton grabbed a double double with 11 and 16, and CP3 dished out 8 assists as the Suns improve to 6-2 on the early season. The addition of Paul has really helped this team continue what they started in Orlando 
   * The Raptors on the other hand took another L and now fall to 1-6 on the season, and especially with the season being shortened 10 games, they need to figure this out soon. Siakam had his best game of the season dropping 32 points to go with 9 rebounds, but still was not enough to take down Phoenix  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Hitters

* Davis Bertans came off the bench but played 32 minutes and ended up starting the 2nd half instead of Avdija who only saw 15 minutes of action. Bertans has seen back to back games of 30+ minutes and is seeming like he is back to startable territory due to his 3pt presence
* Seth Curry caught fire with 28 points shooting 11/14 from the field and 6/7 from three, which included a 5/5 first quarter from beyond the arc
* Early DPOY front-runner in my eyes, Myles Turner was at it again, this time swatting 8 shots against the Rockets 
* Tatum and Brown combine for 48 in Celtics dub over Heat
* Jimmy Butler plays his best game of the season dropping in 26 points in the loss to the C's 
* Zion and BI combine for 53 in the loss to OKC
* Steven Adams records his first career triple double with a 10/11/10 line
* Coby was not the only Bull doing work, LaVine put up 32 points and Carter grabbed a double-double with 11 points and 17 boards
* DeAaron Fox left the game with hamstring tightness and did not return for the 2nd half, his injury will be one to monitor for sure, I personally do not believe it is too serious as he was celebrating the win with his team on the bench and was moving around. 
* Bagley put up his best game of his season with 21 points and 12 boards, while running mate Richaun Holmes added 24 points on 10/11 shooting as well
* PG and Kawhi match each other with 21 a piece in the Clippers win over the Warriors as Steph struggles with his shot only scoring 13 points

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Report

&amp;#x200B;

* Tyrese Haliburton 
   * Haliburton came back after missing his past two games and after not doing much in the game, turned up in the 4th quarter scoring 15 of 17 points, which included some clutch 3s, and finished the game with 7 boards, 6 assists, and 3 steals. Fox went down in the first half with hamstring tightness, which I do not believe to be too serious, but still he missed the remainder of the game and if is forced to miss time, Haliburton is for sure startable in my eyes and a great DFS play
* Lamelo Ball
   * Ball continues to really show out scoring 16 points on 6/12 shooting and snagging 8 boards to go along with 5 assists. The BC Vytautas product has started to come into his own and is looking like a real threat in this league. He only saw 23 minutes of action tonight, but more minutes are bound to be coming this way if he keeps this play up
* Issac Okoro
   * Okoro returned back to the starting lineup after missing the past 5 games for the Cavs and saw 28 minutes if action. He scored 10 points on 4/5 shooting, while he is not the most attractive fantasy player currently, he should be monitored in 9cat leagues due to his efficiency and has a do-it-all type game 
* Saddiq Bey
   * Bey poured in 20 points and grabbed 10 boards for his first career double double in 24 minutes.  Bey has had a solid start to his career in Detroit and is a player that is worth adding, due to him starting and playing around 30 minutes when the Pistons opt to rest Blake 
* Payton Prtichard
   * Pritchard continues to produce early on and especially without Teague in the lineup. Pritchard saw just 20 minutes last night though with Smart returning to the lineup, but scored 6 points including the game winning tip and grabbed 6 boards and had 4 dishes. He struggled with his shot going 3/10 from the field and 0/4 from three, but I would not be too concerned about that for now as his prior game he shot 8/13 from the field and 2/4 from three. Pritchard's season long value is not as promising though because eventually Kemba will be back for this team and Teague will still be there starting too for now 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am Excited to see tonight

* The Balkan Battle
   * Jokic and the Nuggets are taking on Luka and the Mavs in what is sure to be a fun game from the two European studs, won't be suprised if both players end with triple doubles
* Kyrie and the KD-less Nets get to take on Embiid and the sizzling 76ers
   * Two of the top Eastern Conference squads take on each other tonight, but how will the Nets fare with no KD, will they be able to repeat what they did vs Utah

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the Night: Bradley Beal(60 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 20/35 from the field, 38 minutes)

Dud of the Night: Trae Young(7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 2/9 from the field, 35 minutes)

Rook of the Night: Tyrese Haliburton(17 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 7/15 from the field, 34 minutes)

Player to Target: Cole Anthony 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope y'all enjoyed the run-down, see you tomorrow

"There are supposedly talks of NBA expansion and Seattle - if you believe the rumors - is at the top of the list of cities capable/deserving of a team. 

If the NBA was to expand it would likely add 2 teams rather than just the one. 

What other city would be the best fit for a new franchise and why?  

Vegas seems like the obvious answer for a number of reasons. Or do they go international and look at returning to Vancouver or opening shop in Mexico City? Perhaps the Cincinnati/Louisville/Lexington? Reward the heartland with another team in either St. Louis or KC? California seemingly has enough teams and they were indifferent toward the Chargers, but San Diego is the largest city in America without an NBA team.",Along with Seattle - what other city would be the best for an NBA expansion team?
"i was watching the game last night and noticed something interesting.. they had Dennis/Wes/Kuzma/Bron/AD out there.. going to run a high pnr with Bron/AD as they normally do at the end of games, so seeing the lineup my guess was okay.. it's going to be 5 out, spread pnr 

then i saw AD point to Dennis to stand in the dunker spot.. which was interesting.. https://i.imgur.com/U3Y5GW2.png

AD then sets the screen for LeBron, and as LeBron gets inside the three point line, Dennis runs to the three https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png

AD dunking the ball while Dennis is at the three https://i.imgur.com/YHr8m0k.png

reasons for doing this 

typically, a smaller player would be on Dennis, so when they come to help AD can just finish over them 

secondly, https://i.imgur.com/llZUbXk.png looking at this picture, Brandon Clarke is the help guy now who was guarding Dennis, so Tyus has to be the in between guy focusing on Dennis running to the three and Wes in the corner, that's a pretty routine pass for AD if he chooses to do that 

just something i found interesting, don't typically see a 5 out pnr ran like this",Lakers run a LeBron/AD pnr with a wrinkle

Wow. I thought the Pistons didnt keep Wood because he didnt want to stay, but aparently they just werent willing to offer him more than they offered Mason fucking Plumlee lol

Well, thank god the Rockets got him

"The goal here is to try to make the best 15 man expansion team off non-protected players.

Rules:

1) Assume its the 2021 offseason and we're having an expansion draft

2) Post 8 players/rights from your favorite team that you would like to protect as a parent comment. To make it more interesting, this includes restricted/bird/non-bird salary rights. For example, the Hawks can use a keeper on John Collins' restricted rights this offseason instead of an 8th actual player considering Collins is going to be an FA and not under contract with the Hawks this offseason.

3) I'll reply in the comment thread on who I'm plucking your team (only 1 player per team.) I can choose a player's restricted rights instead if you do not choose to protect them. 

4) Obviously since there are more teams than roster spots, I can choose to pass on picking from your team",League Expansion Game
"Ben Simmons and Draymond Green are two of my favorite players to watch and I think both have similar, but unique skillsets that I thought would be fun to compare, and I’m curious which player would be more valuable to your favorite team? 

Ben obviously is not close to Draymond in terms of legacy right now. Dray has proven to be a ‘16 game player’ and a champion. Ben has been co-leader of a winning team each year of his career  but hasn’t got past the 2nd round in the 2 playoff runs he played.

That being said In terms of skills I think they’re both great in transition. Ben is faster but I think a little more turnover prone than Dray. They both focus on finding shooters and Draymond clearly knows how to get Steph and Klay open. (For example look at the last shot Steph got for 62!)

In the half court they have different roles. Draymond is a more willing shooter and roller and Ben is a better at driving off the dribble and a bit better at better at passing imo.

And on defense they’re both great but in different ways. Draymond will anchor and coach a defense as well as anyone in the league and he’s so smart at reading pick and rolls and knowing players offensive habits so he can stifle them.

Ben on the other hand will defend the hell out of your best scorer and could very well be the best  1v1 defender in the league, while leading the league in steals last year, but he won’t be a rim protector. 

Who would you add to your team right now? I’d imagine the choice will differ depending on the team.",Simmons and Draymond side by side

I'd be interested to hear them discuss anything about basketball and their careers.,Many years from now do you think there will ever be a 1-on-1 interview between Michael Jordan and Lebron James?
Money wise I know it would be a plus but I mean in terms of viewership. We would have 2 more teams which will probably suck for the first few years and it would add to the already abundance of not so good teams. A lot of the teams in the nba aren’t that good and adding more would just spread out the talent more and worsen the situation.,Would an expansion team be better Orr worse for the NBA?

"As a Knicks fan, I am used to my team being projected to lose. They have not been the Vegas favorite to win in a single game this season. I pulled up the over/unders for the season to compare Vegas predictions to actual game outcomes and the Knicks have been the most underrated team of this young season. This figure shows the difference between actual and Vegas-predicted victories (teams that have beaten their odds plot higher on the y-axis):

[Actual vs predicted wins for 2020-2021 season](https://imgur.com/6nfIeWo)

I was curious how these trends stacked up against the last several years, so I pulled in data from the 2014-2019 seasons for comparison. The solid lines show a 1:1 trend (i.e., if Vegas predictions were perfect) and the dotted lines show the actual trends for each season. Lower slopes for the actual trendlines indicate that Vegas' predictions favored the high-win teams too frequently.

[Actual vs predicted wins from 2014-2019](https://imgur.com/rkQlbL4)

On average, Vegas predicts teams that finish &gt;0.500 will win 9% more frequently than they do, while &lt;0.500 teams are picked to lose 23% more frequently than they do.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The former Los Angeles Lakers center also mocked Gobert, a player for the Utah Jazz, posting a photoshopped photo of him dunking on Gobert with the caption: “I would had 45 pts 16 rebound ten missed free throws in three quarters. He woulda had 11 pts four rebounds and fouled out in 3 quarters. I’m a G ”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Rudy responded on IG with: “I guess we’ll never know” and then continued on Twitter: “There is no beef.

"It’s wayyy too soon to make any declarative statements here, but this draft class has a number of players that have impressed already. 

Oh before I go further, if you just want to hear the question and respond:

tl;dr, How normal is this for young players in their first 10 games? Has this draft already exceeded expectations? How have the rookies this year looked in comparison to previous years? Better or worse?


Wiseman and Edwards have both impressed, lamelo has been promising (although he has some cold streaks), Devin Vassell has been a rookie that pop believes in enough to play, Pat Williams has been impressive in Chicago, and, of course, Haliburton has been incredible. 

I don’t think this proves necessarily that everyone was sleeping on the draft class saying “no one is worth trading up for.” I’m really not sure how many rookies over perform in their first few games. I am a stupid man so I can’t remember what the normal amount of impressive rookies is. However, there’s a lot of guys to be excited about. Hope we see more promise as we get further(think when Killian Hayes, obi toppin, and Isaac okoro have shown flashes as well, okoro is looking like a guy who could play for a long time). Also think both quickley and tyrese maxey have all the makings of a guys who could develop into solid contributors  for any team  long term.

"It would probably be a cheap trade too. Most likely a second round pick and  another 2nd round pick swap (where NY gets the better of the 2)for Dennis and it’s a low risk high reward thing.

&gt;Ibaka wanted to stay with the Raptors and even coming off a career-year, the veteran understood that it might mean having to settle for a one-year deal as the club was doing everything in their power to avoid taking on commitments that would interfere with their cap space in 2021.

&gt;But the Raptors’ first offer – about $12 million for the 2020-21 season – was below what he was expecting and while Toronto came up to $14 million, they were still trying to keep some powder dry to pursue Gasol. That didn’t go over well with Ibaka who, according to multiple sources, resented having to play behind the Spanish international and wasn’t going to sign on for a shared role again. Ibaka quickly pivoted to the Los Angeles Clippers and their two-year deal for $19 million.

&gt;In retrospect, the Raptors absolutely could have kept Ibaka without being a tax team or otherwise altering their off-season plans now or in the future.

Reading this little tidbit from the article, it looks like the Raptors gave Serge a lower offer than he had expected at first, a one year $12 million dollar deal. Then they brought it up to $14 million, but also wanted to keep their options open to retain Marc Gasol as well. Apparently, this was a reason Ibaka decided to go to LA because he didn't want to share a role with Gasol. Serge now gets what he wants, starting for the Clippers. The Raptors end up losing both.

Curry (32 years old): Just dropped a new career high, 30 ppg. 

Just a small sample size. Are 30s considered the new prime?",Are 30s the new prime for players these days?
"Obviously it's still early days, and the only time any of them have faced each other in the playoffs was last year during the Nuggets vs Lakers series. However, I feel like these are the 3 best bigs we've had in a long time. 

All of them are incredibly skilled, AD and Embiid are great defenders, Jokic is a generational playmaker.",Could Embiid/Jokic/AD turn into a rivalry like Olajuwon/Robinson/Ewing was?
"https://twitter.com/nbakicks/status/1341986986245033984?s=21 

For those like me who keep up with who’s wearing what and who’s signed to which brand, this is a really strange sight to see. Andre has been a Nike guy since his rookie year but looks like he either quietly signed a deal with Adidas or is currently a sneaker free agent.

Edit: will be sad not to see him in Nike since he had some of the best PE colorways.",Long time Nike athlete Andre Iguodala wearing the Adidas Yeezy QNTM basketball shoes.
"Beal went into the 4th quarter with 57 points. He hit a jump shot at the 6:35 mark of the 4th and did not score again until a free throw with 4 seconds remaining. It's too bad, it seemed like he had a shot to get 70 but he started bricking at the worst time. Seemed like he ran out of gas.",Bradley Beal in the 4th quarter: 3 points on 1/6 shooting
"In today's game between the Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers, a new record was set for most points between both teams in the 2nd quarter, toppling the previous record of 91 with a combined total of 92.

The 76ers contributed with 49 points, while the Washington Wizards added 43.

"Watching the games this year has been...interesting. The lamelo fine got me thinking, Does anyone on this sub have data or the ability to track flops per game? I've become genuinely curious to see how teams and players are utilizing the flop to influence wins.I think its gotta be trae, pg, or dame at the top of the list, but flopping has become such an integral and important part of offense in today's game that I'd love if someone out there knew if there was access to this data. Also, who's flop attempts convert to points the most often? It'd be interesting to see flop conversions as a stat as well because it's very close to a shot now. I imagine harden is the best at converting flops to points, but im not sure.",Request for Flopping statistics
"Seriously, why?

Devonte went 2/14 today. He is literal trash, and one late game three means nothing when he’s awful. Devonte played 16 MORE minutes than Lamelo.

Lamelo just looks legit. In 23 min tonight, he put up 16/8/5 on 50/40/100 splits. What’s it gonna take for him to start?",Why is Devonte Graham still starting over Lamelo?
"36 year old Lebron James just jogged through a 26 point, 11 rebound, and 7 assist game on 55% FG%

These numbers don’t look crazy or anything, but if yoh watched a game and saw just how much he didn’t give a fuck about this random tuesday night game in memphis and still put numbers up, at his age, is ridiculous.","36 year old Lebron James just jogged through a 26 point(21 in the second half), 11 rebound, and 7 assist game on 55% FG%."
"They just showed it, sometime above 7 minutes left in the 3rd. Some of those old masks looked terrifying, one dude was basically Jason","[Pic Request] Both of the ""Masked Man"" graphics from the Clippers-Warriors game"
I know that we're only a few games into the season but the Knicks have been playing some really solid basketball as of late.,Do you think the Knicks are playoff contenders for real? Or is it too early to tell?
"The full times article is interesting as well, dealing with Booker's journey and hopes for the season: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/sports/basketball/devin-booker-phoenix-suns.html","“I’m not James Naismith, by no means,” - Chris Paul scoffed at suggestions that he was brought to only be in a mentorship role, vociferously denying he was the late inventor of Basketball, according to NYTimes article describing his ontological stance on the matter."
"I was watching some Cole Anthony's highlight. And I can see some similarities between him and Steve Nash. But Cole is more like a faster and athletic version of Nash.

Your thoughts?",Cole Anthony and Steve Nash
"Basically a league for retired players to keep playing. Think about the charity games, but a true league with teams, a season, etc. Gives fans a chance to keep seeing some of their favorites, and gives the players a way to ease into retirement instead of the sudden nothingness. 

It doesn't have to be just basketball either. Using baseball instead, you could have A, AA, AAA, Pros, then R1, R2, and R3 leagues on the other end.

Think anyone would be interested, either fans or players?

I'm not going to do anything with this, just an idea I wanted to share somewhere :-)",R(retirement) League idea
"I would think with technology of today, less season ending injuries would be happening. I have always felt that euro steps were weird because you are forcing your legs and body to go different directions, putting a lot pressure on the knees. 

Asking as an overweight man in his late 30s still tryna play ball but probably shouldn't be euro stepping at the local 24.","[Question] After watching the Fultz injury, any sports doctors know if ""Euro Steps"" are causing more strain and injuries?"

"Looking at Blake's stats this season, he is shooting terribly at below 40% from the field with than 15ppg. Is he washed or is he just really rusty after missing almost a full season to rehab?",Is Blake Griffin washed up or injured?
"As it stands 9 guys have scored 60. Bron, Steph, Beal, Melo, Harden, Dame, Kemba, Melo, and Booker. How many guys do you think could score 60, and by really tried I mean like playing all 48 vs the worst defense in the league. I think AD, Kawhi, Durant, Giannis, and Kyrie could. Maybe Zach Lavine if he shot enough shots

Edit: Klay did too",How many players do you think could drop 60 if they really tried?

"Ever since I've been an NBA fan, the West was a conference that had absolute powerhouse teams. I've always found the 2007-2008 season very interesting for the very reason. I don't want this to come off as an insult to the East teams now, cause I think now the East is in a very interesting spot w/ loads of young talent doing well for their teams &amp; who have a lot of good seasons in the future. The west was fully loaded &amp; if you wanted to make the playoffs that year in the west, you HAD to play your heart out every single game.

The Southwest division had 4, FOUR, 50+ win teams. No division in the East had more than 2, &amp; only 3 East teams had more than 50 wins.

No West team secured a playoff spot until April 4, 2008.

The Rockets &amp; Suns had the same record, 55-27, though Rockets were placed a seed higher. The Rockets were 5th seed &amp; Suns were 6th.

Utah had the 4 seed despite Phoenix &amp; Houston having a better record, b/c Utah won their division. This meant 3 games seperated the 6th seed &amp; the 1st seed.

If the playoffs were just an 8 team tournament featuring the highest Win%, Boston, 66-16, &amp; Detroit, 59-23, would have the top 2. The other 6 spots would all be West teams.

The 38-44 Sacramento Kings, had they played in the East, would've made the 8th seed. On top of that, Golden State missed the playoffs by 2 games. If they were in the East, they'd have the 4 seed.

At the time, Golden State had the highest win% for a non-playoff team since the 8 team playoff format. This was tied by the 2013-2014 Phoenix Suns.

Every Playoff team in the West had at least 50 wins.

Finally, despite all of this, Boston beat Los Angeles for the NBA Championship.

Is there any other season that showed how lop-sided talent &amp; competition was than 07-08?",Has any season shown more of a talent &amp; competition gap than the 2007-2008 season?

"After watching Wizards let Embiid score 10 straight when the game was tied with 3 mins left, I was dumbfounded to see lineup:

ish Russ Beal Bertans and Bryant.

Clearly it is BBQ Chicken for Embiid. I was not surprised that Sixers dominated the rest of the game w 4/5 players half the size of Embiid and Simmons.

I get why Brooks left the team on the floor. It's the lineup that led the comeback. But that's the thing. They needed offensive fire power for any come back.

But with 3 mins left, 10 possessions left at most, you gotta play defensive players. It's a more conservative strategy to try to prevent the offense scoring in last 10. Take it possession by possession.

Embiid is the best center in the league. But the Wizards made it easy for him to score. They should have put in Lopez for Bertans and potentially do offense and defense rotations.","In a close game in the 4th, less than 5 points either way, it's more important to make stops with limited possessions left"

"New Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith joins The Woj Pod to discuss transforming his fandom into buying franchise, arriving along with Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert extension talks, leveraging NBA platform for social equality and charity and translating success of his tech empire into Jazz culture.

You can listen to, or download, their conversation on this link: https://traffic.megaphone.fm/ESP6909522314.mp3","Utah Jazz's owner, Ryan Smith, was a guest on ""The Woj Pod"""
"If Doc sends Austin a message tonight saying ""good game son"" is that legally tampering? If he tweets it will he get fined? What if he said something like ""wow good shooting wish some of my guys in Philly had that kinda hot hand!"" Is that stepping over the line? Seriously guys just looking for answers thanks",Tampering question
"Allen was definitely the best center in tonight's game, even though he was matched up against 2x DPOY and $200mil contract star center Rudy Gobert. He was spectacular both offensively and defensively, holding the Jazz to only 21/50 (41%) shooting from inside the 3pt arc, adding 3 steals and 2 blocks, all while only having 1 personal foul. The Jazz didn't lead once for the entire game and the Nets easily blew them out by 34, even without KD.
  
On the other side, Gobert had 10 points and 11 rebounds on 3/10 shooting. Tough nights happen, but it was very impressive how Allen was able to outperform a star center on both ends of the floor. He has a bright future.  
  
EDIT: Allen also had a mean poster right over Rudy, and both of his blocks came against Gobert himself at the rim.","Jarrett Allen matched up against 2x DPOY Rudy Gobert: 19 points, 18 rebounds on 8/9 shooting"
"From Seth Partnow's [recent Athletic Article](https://theathletic.com/2298827/2021/01/05/stephen-curry-points-warriors-joel-embiid-ben-simmons-collin-sexton-cavs/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=curry):

&gt;Prior to Sunday’s career-high 62-point explosion, “What’s wrong with Steph?” seemed like a much more live topic. He seems to quite dispositively have answered the question on his own in the two games since.
&gt;
&gt;That said, it might still be worth a reminder that even for the best players, bad streaks happen. A “bad streak” for Curry saw him open the season with a True Shooting Percentage of “only” 58.3 — still well above league average — on a gargantuan 32.2 usage rate. However, he had made only 18-of-56 3-pointers. Everybody panic!
&gt;
&gt;Except, such a string of rough shooting is … entirely normal. Throughout his career, Curry has had stretches of five consecutive games during which his total 3-point accuracy was 32.1 percent (his mark through five games this season) 48 times, or roughly once every 13 games. In other words, once a month.
&gt;
&gt;It just so happens that because his latest string came in the first five games of a season in which the Warriors’ find themselves bereft of talent — Kelly Oubre’s Golden State career could hardly have started worse, with two good performance lifting his season-long PER from 2.0 to a still unsightly 7.7 — after a long layoff, we were primed for a weekend of overreacting.

So, if you're worried about a player's shooting percentages this early, give them another month or so. It's early in the season.","[Partnow] Even for the best players, bad streaks happen...

Another impressive performance by Jokic despite going into foul trouble early and missing some easy shots. Nuggets improve to 3-4 and Jokic's MVP run has started.,Jokic drops 35/15/6 on 12/20 shooting with 1/1 from 3. Also adds 3 steals and a block.
"There is literally 3-4 guys that could go #1 who are all super prospects.

- Suggs
- Kuminga
- Cunningham 
- Green
- Mobley",Is this the most loaded draft class since 2003?
Wasn’t following basketball ball at the time. Hopefully you guys can provide some insight on this. Context was this question is whether or not Wade or Durant was the #3 behind Lebron and Kobe.,Was Kevin Durant a top 3 player in the NBA from ‘09-‘11?
"I'll preface this by saying I don't get to watch the Sixers much and so don't really know the ins and outs of their game, but I see the take a lot that Simmons and Embiid don't really fit together. We've seen oversized point guard and center duos be successful before like Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq. I know Simmons sucks at shooting, but if they were surrounded by shooters and strong defenders/role players I feel like it could work. Why is there such a lack of faith in their pairing long term?

Edit: I dont mean to imply at all that they are as good as those other duos. Just asking why stylistically it doesnt seem like many people think their games could work together when we've seen similar skill sets matched together before.","If Magic/Kareem and Penny/Shaq worked, Why Not Embiid and Simmons?"
"With averages of 24.1 Points, 11.7 Rebounds and 11.9 Assists, Jokic has established himself as a prime MVP candidate despite the Nuggets' lackluster 3-4 start. He leads the league in BPM (and VORP) and is second in PER at 31.1 (trailing only  at 31.6).

Despite all this, Jokic boasts a usage rate of only 26.8%, which is the 34th highest in the league. For comparison,  leads the league at 37.3%. This is even stranger when we consider the fact that a traditional big man like Drummond has a usage rate of 29.4%, which ranks 20th in the NBA.

This came as a big surprise to me, as Jokic seemingly affects everything on offense when he's on the court. 

Jokic also has a TS% of 70%, which is 9th in the league

Interesting side note: Jokic also has the the 6th best defensive BPM of 2.5, which is just below . This definitely over rates his defense but perhaps shows he's not a regular season liability on that end.

[Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html)","Despite leading the league in Assists, Assist % and BPM, and being second in PER, Nikola Jokic only has the 34th highest usage rate in the NBA (26.8%)"
"What players do you think would have benefitted the most from playing in a different era because of the style of the game (not the level of competition)? There are so many players of past generations whose talents could have been maximized in another era.

I always think of a guy like Steve Nash whose production skyrocketed after the hand-check rule was made. The current era would fit him perfectly as a floor-spacing, sharpshooting floor general. 

Conversely, I think Kyrie would have feasted in the early-mid 2000s as an ISO scorer with great playmaking abilities.

What do you think?","Who are the ultimate ""played in the wrong generation"" players?"
"People always talk about how Steph Curry is the greatest 3 point shooter of all time, but what about from the midrange and close to the basket? Percentage is part of it, but there is more to it, like who is guarding, when someone makes a shot, like game winners, and whatever else.
Some candidates I immediately thought of.

Midrange: Michael Jordan and Kawhi Leonard

Close: Shaq and Kareem

Those are just random guesses though. Who do you think is the goat at different ranges. Also feel free to discuss from 3 if you think it is not Steph, or who is goat from any other ranges.",Goat from different ranges
I’m wondering if the performance of some players is being affected by the absence of fans.     Are players who normally feed off the crowds energy (like Harden) playing worse? Are mentally weaker players (like Luwawu-Cabarrot) making more clutch shots because they’re not rattled by the crowd?,"Do you think some players are playing better/worse because there are no fans? If so, which players?"
"There was a debate floating around the internet today ranking SG’s in their prime between Tracy Mcgardy, Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade and James Harden. me personally i chose T-Mac, Wade, A.I. then Harden.",prime shooting guards

Hey yall, Im a bit new here, but I am going to start posting these nightly recaps for you guys. Lmk what you guys think! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Nightly Notables

&amp;#x200B;

* Donovan Mitchell and D'Angelo Russell each top 30 points for the first time this season
   * A solid outing for Mitchell in a game in which Utah should have one vs the Nets with no KD
   * Interesting early stat: Mitchell PPG in wins 19.7 PPG, in losses 25.0 PPG
   * Russell had his most aggressive game getting to the line 10 times, doubling his season total attempts from the stripe
   * Encouraging to see that performance from DLo for the Twolves

&amp;#x200B;

* Jarrett Allen monster double double in first start of season
   * Nash opted to start Allen over DJ and it worked out great for the Nets with Allen scoring 19 points and grabbing 18 boards over Gobert and the Jazz
   * It will interesting to see how Nash approaches the center position going forward, but this is great looks for Allen owners 

&amp;#x200B;

* Kyle Kuzma and THT are the ones benefiting from KCP injury
   * Interestingly the Lakers have been starting Kuzma in place of KCP's injury and he has seen 30 minutes in each of his last two games
   * Talen Horton-Tucker has seen 20+ in each of these past two games with no KCP as well
   * Both have not done much with these opportunities, but are both options that would not be horrible value plays on DFS if KCP is still out

&amp;#x200B;

* Juancho Explosion
   * Juancho Hernangomez unloaded on his former team with 25 points, shooting 10/14 and 5/8 from three 
   * There is just no way he can keep that play up, but it was fun to watch him catch fire against his old teammates
   * Another old teammate on Denver that got some extended run was Jarred Vanderbilt, the high-motor player saw 23 minutes of the bench and scored 11 points along with 5 boards. Vanderbilt is a great rebounder, so it will be interesting to see if he gets more time as the season continues, Naz Reid only saw 10 minutes as Minn opted to play a little bit smaller

&amp;#x200B;

* Paul George sits out, Kawhi shows out
   * PG was out, so we got a look on how this Clips team will operate without one of there main studs
   * Kawhi had a season high 30 points on shooting 13/22 from the field in 37 minutes, a big bounce back game from Phoenix where he shot 4/21. Leonard also racked up 10 assists which was also a season high, interestingly he is averaging 6.5 APG which would be a career high 
   * Kennard and Batum both topped 35 min with PG's absence as well. Batum scored 21 points which is his season high, but Kennard struggled from the field shooting 3/10

&amp;#x200B;

* Suite Life of Zach and Coby
   * LaVine and Coby combined for 39 points and 80 minutes in last night's comeback dub over the Blazers. Honestly, modest numbers in a sense that either one of these two could explode for 30,40+ on a given night, but these two are going to see a lot of action during this Western conference trip. Sato is out with Covid rules so Coby is seeing all the run at PG and if the Bulls want to stay in games, LaVine needs to be on the court. It will be interesting to see if the Bulls could ride the momentum they have started to brew on this trip out west. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Watch:

Anthony Edwards: Played 25 minutes against the Nuggets which has been pretty on par with is playtime throughout the season, he hoisted up 19 shots, but went 1/7 from three. His 28% from the three is not exactly what you want to see early, but that was his 7th game of his career and he seems like he has the confidence and ability to improve that. Regardless when he is on the floor he is the focal point, his 25.8 usage% is first for rookies playing over 10 min a game, but Melo Ball is very close behind at 25.5%

&amp;#x200B;

Facundo Campazzo: Lol is this guy really counting as a rookie, Facu has started to come into his own these past two games for Denver. He's seen 20+ minutes in each of those games and had double digit outing in each of those games. He only had two assists  in each of those games, but this man is a natural born playmaker, and if Malone keeps giving him minutes, those numbers are bound to rise

&amp;#x200B;

Desmond Bane: Saw 20+ minutes for the 6th time in 7 games although only scoring 7 points , encouragingly in his past 6 games he has shot at least 4 threes a game and is shooting 47% from three on the season. 

&amp;#x200B;

Devin Vassell: Only played 16 minutes last night, but the shooting was on display going 3/4 from three with 12 points. Vassell is playing behind some good talent in SA, but if he is shooting 54%(obviously cannot sustain this but impressive start) from three right now, more minutes should be eventually coming to him. He has also racked up 5 steals over his past three games. The 3&amp;D player he was advertised of at FSU is starting to show it in the league. 

&amp;#x200B;

Patrick Williams: Williams scored 14 points in 24 minutes in Chicago's come back dub. Williams is continuously showing flashes of his high potential. He really won't be the focal point of this offense at all this season, but he is a little bit of everything type of player and is shooting the ball well making him an attractive 9 cat piece.

&amp;#x200B;

Stud of the night: Nikola Jokic(35 Pts, 15 Rebs, 6 Asts, 12/20 shooting)

Dud of the night: Demar DeRozan(6 Pts, 5 Rebs, 6 Asts, 3/9 shooting)

Rook of the Night: Devin Vassell(12 Pts, 2 Rebs, 1 Stl, 4/5 Shooting, 16 mins)

Player to target: Facundo Campazzo

We pulled off an improbable finals run by beating the team with the best record in the NBA, most PPG in the league, as well as the the best DEF rating in the league. Notice how I said TEAM and could care less about the 2x B2B MVP they have as well. 

On top of that we beat a Celtics team that has gone to the ECF the last 3 out of 4 years with Jaylen, Tatum AND a brand new addition in Kemba Walker. 

I understand the “bubble” adds a certain X-factor to the equation that we can’t physically see in terms of data but when are people going to accept that our squad was and is actually great? 

I’ve never been more excited about the future of our team in terms of young talent with a core such as ours ESPECIALLY with the coaching talent we have to groom them. 

I’ve be on vacation from NBA Reddit for quite a bit so I’m not sure what the current consensus is on us, but let me tell you NBA Twitter is a bunch of casuals. It’s time I come back home lol.

The question I have for you all is, what makes everyone think we can’t do the same thing again?",[NBA CENTRAL] An anonymous scout calls the Miami Heat’s 2020 finals run a “situational overachievement”
"This doesn't have to be a massive bust or even a high profile guy, for me it'd probably be Frank Ntilikina. I was so sure that guy was gonna work. But no one is perfect at evaluating talent, so who are your big misses when it comes to cant miss prospects?","Who was your ""cant miss prospect"" who turned out to not live up to your hype?"

|^[boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com](https://boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com/) ^by ^/u/bazman1976 ^(original work by /u/Obi-Wan_Ginobili)|",[Post Game Thread] The Los Angeles Lakers (6-2) defeat the Memphis Grizzlies (2-5) 94-92
"So in football there’s a kicker to take all your kicks, which are kinda of like free throws. Ofcourse no fouls lead to the kick, but nonetheless there are designated positions for that.

What if players like JJ redick or Jose Calderon could be signed for the sole purpose of making fts.

The points should still count for the player who took the beating in the first place because I know James Harden won’t be happy if 10 points get take away from his 34 ppg. 

The FT shooters themselves can be judged on FT’s made and FT’s attempted, no need for points. 

There is also the chance for increased foulbaiting because it’s more assured points, but to change that, what if these FT positions for every 4th foul your worst free throw shooter takes two. Therefore you’ll want to avoid, especially in the 4th quarte, the chance of your worst free throw shooter taking the game winning FT’s.

Dumb idea, but also pretty creative imo",What if teams could sign FT positions?
"Hi everyone, if this has been brought up before, this can be taken down. I was thinking a little bit this morning on what Adam Silver mentioned the other day about expansion and what would be needed to expand the league. But my question to you all is this...

Could a group of fans ( for Seattle or Las Vegas or some other city) create an investment group of fans like the Green Bay Packers have and make it work in the NBA? 

The idea would be the fans own the team, most likely a shareholders group run the team, but ultimately the team would be owned by the fans. Could this be done in today’s era, and what would be needed to make this happen besides money? 

While this might be a silly idea, I am curious to know honest and open ideas and how to make it work.",Fan owned team in the NBA?
"I think that the NBA has a lot of good choices for expansion and I'll put it in a list.

1.) Bring in Seattle and St. Louis/Kansas City

They should have never gotten rid of Seattle and no other teams are in Missouri.

2.) Bring Seattle and Vancouver and move Pelicans or Grizzlies to the east.

This is logical because Memphis and Louisiana are both in the east and west kind of and you could move either/or. Adding Vancouver could be a good way to bring the NBA more international.",IDK where to post this but I'll put this here and if it gets taken down so be it.
"There are many arguments on here like “KD is the most skilled player” or “Giannis is not skilled enough from a talent standpoint, his success is all predicated on athleticism.”

Has the word “skill” become synonymous with shooting? Think of the most skilled players in the NBA in your opinion. Almost all of them are good shooters, and for good reason as shooting is an important list.

Now ofcourse there are multiple more skilled players than Giannis, but to group him, Ben Simmons, and Westbrook into this “all athleticism minimal skill” seems wrong, no?

Like Giannis may not be the upper echelon of skilled *players*, but for *big men* he might just be.

Better passer than everyone except Jokic. Sabonis and Bam are arguable. Elite defensive IQ. His handles are probably the best in the game for a pf. Has numerous types of finishes, etc.

All of this applies to Ben Simmons too.

Is shooting too reflective of “skills” now?",Has “skilled” become synonymous with good shooter?
"He's looked pretty rough offensively these few games. He's currently averaging 8.5 ppg on 30% fg. He was real solid last year offensively too, He was putting up 16ppg on 40% from three on 5 attempts a game and had a 50% fg. Hoping he can turn it around soon, he's a super solid player.",What has happened to Norman Powell?

Yet he's left-handed in writing. He's naturally born as a lefty but trained himself to be right handed. How come? Wouldn't he dominate even more if he was left handed? I mean look at the MLB. Some stars like Barry Bonds or CC Sabathia are natural righties but play left handed and have been stars that way.,Why is Lebron right handed in basketball?
"My father and I, both avid basketball fans, have an ongoing discussion about starting 5 in a playoff series. Just looking for opinions on who should’ve been chosen over our list.

Me
PG- Curry
SG- Kobe 
SF- Lebron 
PF- Rodman
C- Yao Ming
6- Karl Malone

Dad
PG- MJ
SG- Harden
SF- Bird
PF- Barkley
C- Shaq 
6- Nowitzki

Who would you choose and why? We’ll give our own reasoning on the matchups in the comments

P.S Drinking has been involved in this list so pls take that into account lol. Also we chose to discredit injuries and such. 

Edit- we couldn’t choose the same players, this is all about matchups, we also chose a 6th man over a substitute",Starting 5 in playoff series (All Time)
Title. I liked him as a player and he's a cool guy also. I even bought a red shirt inspired by when he was on GQ. But in Orlando and even more so now his stats look rough out there. I haven't seen many Raptors games after Kawhi and JV (I'm Lithuanian lol) left and that's why I'm asking :),What's up with Siakam?

"This is probably something that is probably best answered by “just start watching” but I want to shoot anyway. I am new to watching sports. I love playing them, but never really was a big spectator. I recently started watching NBA and I have really enjoyed learning about the individual teams. The problem is, the NBA is so BIG. It’s hard to follow all the trades, wins/losses, who is healthy etc. I want to follow a team (the closest one for me would be the Grizzlies), but I still want to understand the many different things that happen outside of one franchise. How do you do it?",How did you get into watching the NBA?
"Who are your new sleepers for the playoffs? Is a certain hyped up player really just a washed bum riding a high? Who is looking like a legit 6MOY? Should Christian Wood's nickname be ""The Cross""? Are the Raptors making the playoffs? Will Julius Randle's legs survive Thibs? Is Jokic your regular season MVP or Finals MVP? Will the All-Star celebrity game be played on 2K? Go off nephews.","A few games into the season, what are your new hot takes?"
"They had Gobert there thrice getting his ass handed to him but not the dagger from Zach. 

Even I didn't notice it until I read the comments from some angry Bulls fans. Has this been a common theme? 

You can watch the video here:  [Top 10 plays of the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkE1UufhFx4)",The NBA top 10 plays on their YouTube channel didn't feature Zach Lavine's dagger.

"It's a short sample size, but do you think Harrell was a good addition to the Lakers? I personally don't see how adding a huge defensive liability at the forward/center position can be considered a solid addition for a defense first team, even if he has scoring punch. 

The Lakers' defense in general just looks mediocre

What do you think?",Was Montrezl Harrell a good acquisition for the Lakers?
"Today I am going to discuss 25 players who are improving dramatically and whose stocks are rising.

**() Overall Rank**

**1 Jaylen Brown (25)**

I expected Brown to be solid but nobody expected this. Just 8 games into this season he has cracked my top 25 for the 1st time in his career while averaging over 26 PPG on over 57% shooting. Kendrick Perkins has been a huge supporter, going as far to say that he is better than Jayson Tatum. That's overboard but at this rate he is a shoe-in for his 1st all-star appearence.

**2 CJ McCollum (28)**

McCollum has always been considered one of the better 2nd options in the league, but he has taken his game to the next level so far. His solid play has already put him in serious consideration for his 1st all-star appearance with over 27 PPG on over 43% shooting from 3 while shooting a ridiculous near 12 3's a game. It is yet to be seen whether he can keep up this insane production throughout a whole season and I have my doubts but if he were to continue at this rate we could potentially be talking even all-NBA level.

**3 Tobias Harris (32)**

Harris has been one of the most efficient scorers in the league for one of the best teams in the NBA. Rivers has given major praise to Doc Rivers so far and the coaching change seems to have done wonders for his game. Shooting over 47% from 3 with a career-best 22.6 PER so far, Harris is inching closer to equaling the value of his max contract right now at least.

**4 Malcolm Brogdon (38)**

Brogdon is probably the most under-the-radar player on this sub right now. He has established himself as one of the best point guards in the East (I currently have him 4th) and has great efficiency while having a career-best year in terms of advanced defensive statistics. He's also shown a knack for clutch plays, hitting a game winner against New Orleans.

**5 Collin Sexton (41)**

Dwyane Wade gave praise to him yesterday, and Sexton is quickly establishing himself as a potential consistent all-star talent starting in 2022. He is able to give you 20 points in his sleep and is shooting over 55% from the field in 7 games while leading Cleveland to a winning record.

**6 John Wall (53)**

Modern medicine is amazing and Wall is proof of this. While not in elite status anymore, similar to Derrick Rose, Wall is proving that he provides value still.

**7 Joe Harris (70)**

Harris has fit in well with the now star studded Nets, shooting over 51% from the 3 so far and looks to be a key piece looking to contend.

**8 Myles Turner (71)**

Turner is low-key on pace to potentially have the best season of his career, shooting over 70% inside the 3 while averaging an insane 3.6 BPG so far. He's shooting more 3's and if his efficiency from there can improve, he could be a top 50 player by season's end.

**9 Julius Randle (76)**

I'm skeptical if the Knicks can keep up this level of success the whole year but Randle's career-best play so far cannot be denied. He's improved in all areas, even defense where he is a plus defensive player for the 1st time in his career. 

**10 Christian Wood (78)**

Wood is quickly moving up my overall list at this rate. He's drawn praise from James Harden and has quickly become a favorite on this sub due to his perseverance in overcoming adversity.

**11 DeJounte Murray (79)**

Murray's game is limited by lack of 3-point-shooting but he does everything else well for a point guard and has nice size. His scoring load has increased by about 30% from the previous season and has come up big in games such as 21 points in a win vs. the Clippers last night.

**12 Mike Conley (87)**

Conley's 1st season in Utah was a disappointment, but so far this season he is starting to change the narrative on him. With solid averages of 18.6 PPG, 5.0 APG, and 4.1 RPG, Conley is proving that he can still be effective as he enters his mid-30's.

**13 Jordan Clarkson (94)**

Clarkson has turned into one of the more underrated scorers off the bench in the league. He is currently averaging 15 PPG on career-best efficiency and has cracked my top 100. He just needs to stop pushing refs.

**14 Seth Curry (98)**

Seth has now cracked my top 100 for the 1st time ever. He is the x-factor behind Philly's success and is averaging over 15 PPG on over 54% shooting from 3 and Seth has not missed a free throw this year. 

**15 Terrence Ross (108)**

I don't think anybody expected Ross to average nearly 21 PPG so far. He has career-bests 41% from 3 and a 20.8 PER. If he continues playing at this pace, he will move into the top 100 quickly.

**16 RJ Barrett (116)**

Barrett has become a dangerous weapon and despite not being drafted to the greatest situation, he is inching closer to a top 100 spot in his 2nd year. However, he is one of the worst 3-point-shooters in the league currently and that needs to improve.

**17 Markelle Fultz (128)**

The eye test shows clear improvement and he has moved up on my list a tiny bit from last year, but his shooting efficiency has regressed. There's a lot to like still, the athleticism is incredible and his playmaking has improved. But the progression of his shooting will determine whether he will be a clear top 100 talent or a more athletic Elfrid Payton.

**18 Mikal Bridges (138)**

To go along with being a favorite of defensive analytics, Bridges is also shooting over 46% from 3 so far this year. Unquestionably, the addition of Chris Paul has helped Mikal continue to progress and at this rate he will be near the top 100 by the end of the year.

**19 Deandre Hunter (148)**

Hunter's reviews after his rookie year were really not good, but he's showing why he was picked 4th overall in his 2nd year. Hunter's offensive game has developed as he is currently shooting over 48% from 3 while averaging nearly 16 PPG. He still has a little bit to go before top 100 after a bad rookie year, but he's looking good.

**20 Avery Bradley (192)**

Bradley's role wasn't expected to be as big as it was but he's taking advantage, averaging 13 PPG on 59% shooting from the field and over 52% from 3. It's only been 5 games but Bradley is looking promising so far.",20 Players Progressing Rapidly

"Hey all, big time NBA fan here. 

I follow basketball on all of my social media platforms. I can’t get enough of it. The personalities of the players, the athleticism, showmanship, teamwork, the statistics, and especially the camaraderie between players on the courts which is really quite beautiful to see so many talented people being able to share their passion and talents with one another, much like when artists collaborate. On top of it all, the NBA in particular is lead gloriously by Commissioner Adam Silver, who has proven how deeply empathetic and intelligent he is since taking over the league. He is a stand up guy, a person who everyone can look up to in how he handles social issues and impossible tasks. Look how he handled The Bubble. Crazy. What I’m trying to get to is that Adam Silver seems to care about people. And he cares about the players. He’s embraced the idea of players around the league opening up about mental health issues, and seems to focus more on their well beings than business operations, which is very unlike many people ‘on top’. With all this being said, it would seem that the rest of the NBA community would share the same empathy for human beings. 

When I read articles and basketball news, I like to read the comments to see how others are thinking (why I still do this, I don’t know). I’m met with TOP comments full of unnecessary hate, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and blatant disrespect towards other commenters and especially the players. Some of these comments are obvious trolls, but others are sincere and I’m baffled how anyone can say some of these things about other human beings. The PG interview last night where he explained how he hasn’t felt this much hate from the community in his 10 years in the league is sad. 

The WNBA page is the worst. Every comments section is riddled with hurtful things about women having no place in basketball, how they should “get back in the kitchen”, and how they’re just plain “boring” to watch. This is their passion. Their life. They’ve dedicated themselves to this life of hard work and training and you’re grading them as “boring”.

I don’t care for the argument “ehh they have no place to whine, they’re millionaires”. A lot of these players are good people with good hearts. They help their communities and donate to charities. They have families. They have humility. They’re human beings. 

Imagine if you dedicated your entire life to your passion only to have strangers screaming in your face, cursing you out, and narrating your reputation on the internet about the flaws in your passion. Wouldn’t feel very good, would it? 

We can be better, basketball community. There’s a fine line between competitive spirit and being an arrogant ass.",The NBA community should not be this toxic.
"The teams in the bubble had the shortest offseason ever and the teams that didn't had the longest. Obviously the teams that made the bubble were better in the first place, but relative to where they were expected to be this season: are the teams that were in the bubble overperforming or underperforming? 

Knicks are way ahead of where I thought they would be and it looks like some of the guys really took the long offseason to work hard and came in in great shape. Haven't watched a lot of the rest of the league to get a feel if that's a wider trend though.",Was being in the bubble a handicap or advantage for teams coming into this season?

Domas is easily the better passer. He’s probably the 2,3,4 best passing big man in the league. Both of them are relatively shot on defense, but Domas blocked a Boogie poster!

Randle is probably the better shooter, as however much Domas improved, Randle has reached god tier on efficiency.

Context: The Cavs signed 6-foot-9 power forward Dean Wade in July of 2019, and the 24-year-old is now in his second season with the squad. 

Dwyane took a shot at himself in his remark, noting how he had a rather forgettable stint with the Cavs. The former 13-time All-Star played just 46 games for Cleveland during the first half of the 2017-18 season. The Cavs eventually traded him to the Heat in exchange for a second-round pick. In his brief tenure as a Cavalier, Dwyane averaged 11.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists in 23.2 minutes per contest.

What do you think Duncan Robinson’s free agency value is so the 21’ FA class? And what player and contract does it compare to?,Duncan Robinson FA Value?
"Do you see that lineup as a bonafide contender if Phoenix had taken Luka?  

They would be in prime position to compete for the next decade easily.  

Booker/Luka are 2 bonafaide #1 options at their current age.  You can't say that about a lot of other teams in the league.

Current teams that have a duo of All NBA guys are

- Lakers 

- Nets

- Clippers",Luka/Booker/CP3 -- What Could've Been?
"Free throws are not taken during the regulation game time.  They accumulate throughout the game and then after regulation both teams take their free throws.  If the score difference at the end of the game is such that the losing team still can't win if they make all their free throws and the winner misses theirs, then the free throws are just skipped.  

This will have the following benefits on the game:

* Eliminate flopping because you won't get the stoppage and free throws immediately.  And your might not get them at all depending on the points you got from normal shots.  Points from normal shots become much more valuable.
* Eliminate intentional fouling at the end of the game.  It does nothing for you now.


This will fix a lot of the problems that the NBA has.",[Discussions] Ideas to eliminate flopping and reduce game stoppage
"What's crackin. *Proof\_Tadpole* is back with another ranking list. We went over point guards, so today we are going over the top 10 small forwards entering the 2020-2021 NBA season. Gonna keep this intro short and sweet.

Note: This is a personal opinionated ranking of the small forwards I think would have a good 2020-2021 season. This is not to be considered as fact. I would also like to mention that with how the game is being played (positionless basketball), what you might think is a small forward, might not be a small forward for me (I would also like to let y'all know that my shooting guard post flopped a lot because of my ranking, which I take the blame for. I would like to thank y'all for the criticism, as it helps me improve on how I see basketball. At the end of the day, we are all fans of the game, and all of your opinions help me to better understand this wonderful game So once again, thank you, and hopefully this list can be somewhat of a come back). So if we disagree, I would like to let y'all know that our definitions are different, and that is okay; we just have to agree to disagree. Also shoutout to Andy Hoops for the inspiration. With that being out of the way, let us begin.

1. Lebron James- This is a no brainer. Like I could just leave it at that, but y'all know I am not going to do that. Last year, The King averaged 25.3 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 34.8% from the field on 6.3 attempts per game (which was the most threes he shot per game in an entire season). He also grabbed 7.8 rebounds a game and lead the whole league in assists at 10.2 assists per game, and ended up placing second place in MVP voting (which he seemed to have a problem with, as he tweeted out ""Only 16 First Place votes"" with 3 laughing emojis. He also said in an interview that he was pissed off about the MVP voting). He then turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 27.6 points on 56.0% shooting from the field and 37.0% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. He played out of his mind in the finals, averaging 29.8 points on 59.1% from the field and 41.7% on 6.0 attempts per game, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game. These numbers and the well coached Lakers team overcame the Heat in 6 games to bring the Larry O'Brian back to Los Angeles, and he was awarded finals MVP for his performance (which was a no brainer), where he said that he finally wanted his ""damn respect"", which he earned based off the performance he had in the playoffs. This season, I expect the Lakers to repeat as NBA champions, and I expect Bron Bron to lead the way (although, I do not expect them to get that top seed like they did last year, as I expect them to cruise through the regular season, and turn it up an notch in the playoffs, where I expect Bron to do most of his damage). At the end of the day, Bron is the best small forward and best player in the league, no doubts about that pick.
2. Kevin Durant- The reason why this list is coming out a little late was because I wanted to see some games from KD. Although the Nets record might be looking a little suspect (besides the first couple of games, that defense is cracking), KD's play has been phenomenal. In 6 games, the mans is averaging 28.2 points on damn near 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% from the field and 45.5% from three on 5.5 attempts per game), 7.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists. Add to that he looks really good (like the achilles tear never happened. Like bro looks like he got new bunnies) and his effort on the defensive end is also there, so he is well on his way to making a full recovery. And even if you didn't want to take in these stats because of the sample size, lets travel back to the 2018-19 season, where the slim reaper averaged 26.0 points on 52.1% shooting and 35.3% shooting from three on 5.0 attempts per game, bringing down 6.4 rebounds, and dishing out 5.9 assists per game (which only earned him an All-NBA Second Team selection). He then turned it up to a whole other level in the playoffs, averaging 32.3 points on 50-40-90 shooting (51.4% shooting from the field, 43.8% from three on 6.7 attempts per game, and 90.3% from the line on 9.3 attempts from the charity stripe), grabbed 4.9 boards and had 4.5 assists a game, before the strained right calf he suffered in the Houston series. He was the game changer in the NBA Finals, as he returned for Game 5 when the warriors were down 3-1. He scored 11 points in the first quarter, however, while trying to post up Ibaka, he ended up suffering an achilles tendon injury (which honestly doesn't seem to bother him at all). I have high expectations for the Nets, as I expect them to compete in a rather stacked Eastern Conference, and I expect KD and Kyrie to lead the way for them to reach their potential.
3. Kawhi Leonard- Mr. Terminator finds himself at the number 3 spot for obvious reasons.  In the 2019-20 season, Kawhi averaged 27.1 points on 47.0% shooting from the field and 37.8% from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.1 rebounds and dished out 4.9 assists per game. He also played great defense (but not to the level that the media and a lot of fans were hyping it up to be, as he had to spend more time and energy on the offensive side of the glass, as the mans was a very integral part of the Clippers offense). His performance on the court rightfully earned him a second team all-NBA selection and a second team all-defense selection. The only problem with Mr. Leonard was that of his load management issues, as people outside of the Clippers bubble thought that this action of his would eventually bite him the back, as they speculated that the team would not have any proper chemistry with each other with the limited amount of games and practices that Kawhi would have with the other players (add that with the fact that Paul George was coming off that shoulder surgery, so the team really could not gel well with one another). The Clippers did seem to have a hot hand around February, but that momentum was squashed when the pandemic hit. Fast forward to late August in the bubble, and wouldn't you have guessed it, the Clippers are struggling in the playoffs. They barely beat Luka and the Mavs in 6 games, got up 3-1 against the Nuggets, and then forgot how to play basketball, as they ended up blowing that 3-1 lead and the series. Now, we all know Paul George wet the bed, but half of the blame is to be put on Kawhi as well (especially with that game 7 shooting, like my god). The stats may show you one thing (as he had good playoff numbers), but the eye test shows you something completely different (like, this was the first time I felt Kawhi was just out of it). But regardless, the past is in the past, and with the additions of Ibaka and Luke Kennard, I still have this team in contention in the west. Now, it is very likely they are not getting past the Lakers, but if they end up seeing them in the playoffs, I expect that to be a good series. So overall, got some pretty solid expectations (I guess more grounded than last year) for Kawhi, and hopefully he can bounce back and forget the disaster that was the 2020 playoffs.
4. Jimmy Butler- Imagine if Rock Lee from Naruto or Asta from Black Clover were an NBA player; you got yourselves Jimmy Butler. He essentially had nothing from the start, but through hard work, dedication, and a killer mindset, was able to go from a 30th overall draft pick who was seen as a glue guy coming off the bench for his defensive skills (so somewhat like Marcus Smart, side note: not hating on Marcus Smart), to a max player and leader of the team that earned their spot in the NBA finals. Coming into the 2019-20 NBA season, Butler was viewed as a locker room cancer and a player that was ""uncoachable"", which lead to a lot of people questioning his decision to sign with the Heat (as he was viewed as a person who wanted to win, but he left the situation he had in Philadelphia, a team that was a couple bounces away from going to overtime with the Raptors, and possibly going to the NBA Finals). A lot of people outside Miami slept on the heat, saying that they would just be a fringe playoff team, and that the signing of Butler was just so that they could put seats in the American Airlines Arena. But straight off the rip, the Heat ad Butler surprised many. Although Butler's 19.9 points on 45.5% shooting and 24.4% shooting from three on 2.1 attempts per game does not look like that of a player belonging on a top 5 spot, the intangibles he brings to the game is what sets him apart from other superstars (and yes, he is a superstar). He had a career high 6.0 assists and 6.7 rebounds per game, to go along with 1.8 steals per game (which truly does not depict his defensive value, as he is such an amazing defensive player, and the leader of that strong Miami defense along with Bam Adebayo). Even after the stellar regular season, a lot of people were still sleeping on the Heat, saying that they would be a second round out at best. However, in the NBA playoffs, Miami and Butler turned up the heat (pun intended). Despite his playoff numbers not being that eye-popping (22.2 points on 48.8% shooting from the field and 34.9% shooting from three on 2.0 attempts per game, 6.5 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.0 steals a game), Butler always kept the Heat in check, and always set the tone for what was one helluva finals run. He went off in the NBA Finals, averaging 26.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game on 55.2% shooting from the field and 30.8% from three, pushing the Lakers to 6 games, despite loosing Goran Dragic and Bam for the majority of that series, and proved to everyone on the planet that he was a winning player, rightfully squashing all of his negative baggage that came with him. Although the Heat seem to be struggling to start off the season (which is expected as they are coming off the shortest off-season in NBA history), I expect them to figure themselves out by the middle of the season, and I expect them to be the same dark horse (because I am just gonna keep it a bean, the Heat are legit), and I expect Jimmy to lead this team, hopefully for another deep playoff run (I really hope this man can get a ring. I loved him on the 76ers, and I was sad that we didn't choose to resign him, but I am happy that he is in a better situation now. Hopefully he don't get that Rock Lee treatment, cuz they did him dirty in Naruto. But like no cap, he do be like Asta doe. Like everyone hated on him, now everyone understands his struggles and appreciates him. Dubs in the comments if you a Black Clover fan, cuz we getting recognized).
5. Jayson Tatum- If Butler is a combination of Rock Lee and Asta, then I guess Tatum think he Deku cuz he thinking that the ""Mamba Mentality"" is like one for all (I know it is corny, and I am so sorry. But for real though, Tatum do be thinking he Kobe, which is not a knock against him, but still. Also, Deku's associated with Green and Tatum on the Celtics, so that reference is hopefully not completely off). Ignoring the corny ass anime reference (which hopefully at least one of y'all get), Tatum is without a doubt a budding star (hell, he is a borderline superstar at this point), and last season was officially his breakout year. In the 2019-20 season, Taco Jay averaged 23.4 points on 45.0% shooting from the field and 40.3% from three on 7.1 attempts per game. He also brought down 7.0 rebounds and dished out 3.0 assists, which earned him the accolade of third team all-NBA. He also contributed to a very elite perimeter defense that was in Boston, and grew to becoming the leader of that young Celtics team. Like Butler, Tatum turned it up in the playoffs, averaging 25.7 points on 43.4% shooting from the field and 37.3% from three on 7.4 attempts per game. He also grabbed 10.0 rebounds and dished out 5.0 assists a game, leading the C's to the Eastern Conference Finals, and were two games away from making the NBA Finals. So far into the young season, Tatum and the Celtics have been looking very good despite that rocky start to the season. This season, I expect the Celtics to take another step in the right direction and to see growth from both Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum (like, I know he grew more into a leader last season, but it always felt like he put up the stats, and guys like Brown, Smart, and Walker were the leaders of that team). I expect him to make an all-NBA, all-Defense (which he was lowkey snubbed for last season), and possibly get some MVP votes.
6. Paul George- I want to preface this by saying that this is not a knock against Mr. Playoff P. We all know that Paul George is going to be great in the regular season (I mean, mans right now is playing like an MVP Candidate, averaging 25.1 points on 50.8% shooting from the field, 49.2% shooting from three on 8.7 attempts per game, and 92.9% shooting from the charity stripe. He is also dishing out 5.1 assists and grabbing 5.7 rebounds per game. He also seems to have a better start with this Clippers team as opposed to last year, as he knows his role on the offensive and defensive side of the floor). But I am not gonna sit around and not mention the atrocity that was ""Pandemic P"" in last season's playoffs, which is the main reason why he is this far down. In the 2020 playoffs, Paul George averaged 20.2 points on 39.8% shooting from the field and 33.3% shooting from three on 8.5 attempts per game, brought down 6.1 rebounds, and dished out 3.8 assists per game. Basically mans switched from playing like an all-NBA player, to a bench player who was brought into the 15 man roster from the G-league, who is trying his hardest to stay on the team. Again, I am not implying that Paul George is bad (in fact, he is pretty good), but all I want from him is consistency. He needs to prove to the basketball community that he is a reliable option in the playoff, and that he isn't just a regular season player.
7. Brandon Ingram- Last year, Brandon Ingram officially had his breaking out season. After being traded to New Orleans from Los Angeles in the Anthony Davis trade, Ingram was able to flourish in his new playing environment. Although the Pelicans were a pretty underwhelming team (kinda falling sort of expectations I guess), Brandon Ingram did not disappoint, averaging 23.8 points on 46.3% shooting from the field and 39.1% shooting from three on 6.2 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.2 rebounds and dished out 4.2 assists per game, which earned him an all-star selection (also got some high respect from one Kevin Durant, noting that his game was very similar to his, saying that he has potential to be an elite player in this league), and won him the Most Improved Player award (although, I personally felt like it should have went to Bam Adebayo). Despite his statistical growth, he showed a lot of promise on the defensive end of the floor and he was able to be the go-to scoring option for this team down the stretch (basically, him being a jack of all traits player in the beginning of his career, which hurt him, is now pretty beneficial for him now). To start off this season, BI has looked strong, averaging 25.0 points on 44.8% shooting from the field and 38.6% from three on 6.3 attempts per game. He is also flourishing as a playmaker, averaging a career high 5.7 assists per game, while bringing down 6.4 rebounds per game. I expect the Pelicans to make some noise this season, and hopefully BI and Zion can lead this team to promising success in the future.
8. Khris Middleton- (These last three spots were very hard, so please do excuse me if I screw up here and there). Middleton finds himself here at number eight (like he is a good to great player and underrated, but at the same time, it really doesn't feel that way. Like, he is just an all-star player). If I were to just describe him, I guess all I can say is that he is somewhat of a second option to Giannis, in the fact that he scores his 20 points on good efficiency (to be more specific, he averaged 20.9 points on 49.7% shooting from the field and 41.5% shooting from three on 5.7 attempts per game. He brought down 6.2 rebounds, and had 4.3 assists per game). He is an above average defensive player and a vocal leader for this Bucks team. He has developed every single year in this tenure with the Bucks, and I expect nothing less from him this season as well (he is already averaging 20 points on 50-40-90 splits, so safe to say that he might end up being an all-star again if he keep this pace). His only problem is that of consistency, as like Paul George, Middleton struggled in the bubble, one of the main reasons why the Bucks were upset against the Heat in the second round. I expect the Bucks to remain competitive, and hopefully Middleton can find a way to solidify his position as the second star of this team.
9. Gordon Hayward- Despite that gruesome leg injury he suffered in the 2018 season and the rocky season he had in 2019, Hayward has relatively bounced back to being a productive starter to a borderline all-star type player. Last season he averaged 17.5 points on 50.0% shooting from the field and 38.3% from three on 4.3 attempts per game. He also brought down 6.7 rebounds and passed for 4.1 assists per game. He did not play a lot in the NBA playoffs, as he was coming off a grade 3 right ankle sprain which he suffered in the first round of the playoffs. He returned in game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, but he saw limited action, and the Celtics were taken out in 6 games. This season with the Hornets (who I really do not know where they will end up in the East), I expect to see increases in Hayward's stats (like as of right now, he is averaging 21.9 points on 49.3% shooting from the field and 36.4% from three on 5.5 attempts per game. He is also averaging 5.8 boards a game and 4.4 assists per game). I highly doubt he will make an all-star tea, but I expect him to be some valuable veteran leadership for this young Hornets team.
10. Duncan Robinson- Robinson finds himself at number 10 to wrap up this list. It is pretty simple to explain his game: He is just a sniper bro. Last season, he averaged 13.5 points on 44.5% shooting from three on 8.3 attempts per game (which is crazy). He was integral to the Miami Heat's success, and although he is pretty shaky to start of the season and teams seem to be guarding him a bit tighter (he is still shooting like 41.1% from three), I expect him to good this season again. Him and Bam have good chemistry on those hand-offs by the elbows, so he will definitely get good looks from three. The Heat will make another run for it in the east, and I expect them and Robinson to turn it up when the time comes.

Honorable Mentions:

1. Robert Covington- I was debating between Roco and Robinson for the tenth spot. However, I looked into the Trailblazers roster, and he is playing the power forward this year (which I guess is expected based off his defense), so he is going to be in my power forward list.
2. Tobais Harris- Same thing I said with Roco. He plays heavy power forward minutes for the 76ers, a position that he blossomed in during his tenure with the Clippers under Doc Rivers, so expect to see him in the power forwards list
3. Joe Ingles- Again, very close with Robinson. But I went with Robinson based off how much he provided that Heat team with. The inside-out game plan of the heat was very fun to watch last year.
4. Andrew Wiggins- I do not know what the hell to expect from him at this point. One day he has an efficient game and the next he just bricks everything. He is very inconsistent
5. Michael Porter Jr.- Give him time. Just give him time and he will hopefully be a key piece to that Nuggets team.
6. T.J. Warren- Prayers up for a speedy recovery. That is all.

"Proven he could carry a mediocre team to a championship (2003), proven he could coexist with another superstar to win a championship (1999), proven he could consistently play well in the regular season (never missed playoffs, never had a season below 50 wins, two MVPs), had insane longevity (contended for 19 years straight, still a good player when he was old), won a lot of championships (5), coexisted with other stars and never had an ego in letting them share the glory (parker, Manu, Kawhi)

Only thing he hasn’t proven is winning without pop I guess.",Has any superstar proven it more than Tim Duncan?
"The Bulls won 6 titles in 8 seasons with Pippen and he's no doubt a historically great player. But I don't think he had the scoring punch of Wade. I personally rate peak D Wade as a top 15-20 player of all time, top 25 at worst. From 2003 to 2011, he played at an insane level both on offense and defense. I don't think Scottie qualifies as such.","Who do you think was better, peak Dwyane Wade or peak Scottie Pippen?"

I feel like I have seen this almost happen many many times but I've never actually seen it happen. So many times guys fall in the paint and there's guys around him jumping for the rebound.,Has a player ever falling down on the court and then another player accidentally jumps on their head?
"In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals. What do you think cause the drastic change in strategy in what were both do or die games?

I know the Clippers are touted as having more offensive options than Toronto had, but there were plenty of raptors that could get their own bucket also in Lowry, FVV, and Siakam... which they all proved in the finals.","In a 2019 second round game 7, Kawhi Leonard attempted 39 field goals against the Philadelphia 76ers, but against the nuggets he only attempted 22 field goals. What do you think cause the drastic change in strategy in what were both do or die games?"
"Who you got and why? I got manu as he has a more varied skill set, pass, shoot, defend, size, less quick but more athletic in other ways. Where as parker seems is not as much of a two way player, and was a worse shooter. I watched them solely in the playoffs, but am curious what others think.",Who would have had a better career if they did not play for the spurs Manu Ginobili or Tony parker?
"I know Spain/Argentina/France/Slavic countries all had amazing talent on their roster, but I think we’d be the only non-USA team to field an entire roster of rotation pieces on NBA teams.

- Jamal Murray
- SGA
- Lu Dort
- Andrew Wiggins
- Dhillon Brooks
- RJ Barrett
- Chris Boucher
- Tristan Thompson
- Khem Birch
- Brandon Clarke
- Kelly Olynyk
- Cory Joseph

(Switch in Dwight Powell and NAW for some of the bigs if you want)","If every Canadian in the NBA is on board with playing in the olympics this year, would they be the most talented non-USA team ever?"
"Context:

&gt;Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future. Unlike other major revenue streams such as TV and ticket money, expansion fees are not split with players. Such a haul could mean about $160 million per team, a windfall that could wipe out the massive debt load that's piling up, and that alone has perked interest in the expansion path.

&gt;Considering there might be multiple offers from cities like Seattle or Las Vegas and that the league knows its business and its bidders, that could be a fair projection. But a potential Wolves sale of $1.5 billion or less would mean a correction in the NBA market after a decade of growth.

&gt;The Utah Jazz, who play in a much smaller market than Minneapolis, sold for $1.66 billion last month to tech billionaire Ryan Smith. That is a strong vote of confidence in the continued rise in franchise value -- but it might have been an outlier.

https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30652450/what-potential-timberwolves-sale-means-nba-expansion","[Windhorst] Within the league office, sources said officials have floated the price tag of $2.5 billion each for two expansion teams in the near future."
"The NBA is already hard enough to watch right now because of the lack of crowds, and now we’re getting players resting on prime time games? It just stinks.

It makes sense for dudes like Demarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant and everyone that recently suffered serious injuries, but it doesn’t make sense to allow young healthy players to sit. Does the NBA just not care about the viewers? 

Maybe the solution is to significantly reduce the amount of games, and I’m okay with it. I’m all for *quality* over *quantity* in this instance. I’m a die hard Cavs fan, but I don’t watch close to every Cavs game because there are so damn many. I don’t think NBA fans would mind not having as many games if they actually got to see their favorite players play.",The NBA seriously needs to do something about resting players.
"I'll start, Wilt Chamberlain (flair checks out); not only was he an athletic freak of nature (most athletic player the sport has ever seen), he actually was very skilled at the game of basketball, he had a great post fade, was very nuanced in the post, and was a disciplined defender. There are some more deeper things i'd like to touch on but this is meant to be more for civil light discussion and not in depth analysis.",Which player has the most misconceptions attached to them?

"&gt;‘This is uncharted territory for most of us’ — Fred VanVleet on Raptors 1-5 start. ‘... we got a boatload of problems’

&gt;‘This game will break your heart ... this stuff keeps me up at night’ —
Fred VanVleet

Kyle Lowry chimed in on the Raptors issues as well

&gt;“Right now we have no swag to us ... teams are looking at us and saying let’s eat ... that’s not a good position at all’ — Kyle Lowry.

"So I heard a lot of stuff on how Levert is a really good player and will be the third star and all that stuff but so far he has looked pretty bad and has a abysmal TS. Now granted this is early and his percentages will might go up but as of now do you think he is overrated?

Just for reference Levert has the exact same TS as Siakam in the 2020 playoffs",Caris Levert so far this season 14.5/3.9/5.5 on 39/29/91 and a 46 TS%. Is he one of the most overrated players/assets in the NBA?

Herro: 14.3

Dragic: 13.8

Bradley: 13.0

Even with Butler's struggles due to his ankle injury, the Heat have had a ton of help from the supporting cast. Its impressive seeing such an ""everybody eats"" offense",The Heat currently have 7 players averaging double digits in ppg this season.
"After a rusty start to the season, DLo had his best game so far against Denver. Really loved to see his synergy with Vanderbilt and the fact that he got more to the FT line.

"If someone had told me before Elfrid Payton was drafted that in 2021 he’d have the 10th most triple doubles of all active nba players, I’d have assumed he would be a top 50 player at least by now. What are some other surprising stats for unassuming players?",What are some surprisingly impressive stats for unassuming players?
"Kyrie is simply too erratic and unpredictable, as good as he is on the court, he could very well just retire tomorrow with no given reason.  KD is desperate for an additional ring to redeem his legacy.  To win one outside of the shadow of Steph/Klay/Draymond, to set him apart as as a top 20 players of all time.  Did he make a mistake in investing his last few years of prime in someone as unpredictable and unreliable as Kyrie?",[Serious] Did Kevin Durant make a mistake of teaming up with the mercurial Kyrie Irving in his pursuit of another ring?
"Rubin had the opportunity to purchase the 76ers in 2011 when he was approached by then-majority owner Ed Snider. Rubin declined and months later joined the bid of Josh Harris and David Blitzer. Rubin is also executive chairman of Fantics.

“I only did it because David Stern told me to do it,” Rubin told Sports Illustrated. “Good owners aren’t buying franchises because they think it’s a good economic deal. They’re buying franchises because they’re a huge fan of the sport and they want to be a steward of that team. If they just do it because of a good economic deal, they’re going to be bad owners.”

Which of your teams and owners are you proud of or wish never happens.  

Tillman is a big inspiration for this, Sarver comes to mind. Reisendorf in 1998 is just unforgiveable .   

  Thunder owner made the catostrophic mistake(not just of moving to oklahoma) but of breaking up a team that wanted to stay together than included 3 mvps.  They've gotten a whole lot better since in terms of how they run their organization","Sixers owner on good ownership, does your team/owner qualify?"

The main thing was to work on my shot. I feel like it’s worked pretty well. I’m comfortable with it.”
"Post ups are weird to me because it changed so much from 30 years ago. They use to abuse mismatches or just back you down. Now they don’t even look for there big to score. I don’t even know who classified as a good Post up scorer because the league change so much with shooting so much 3s. Also people run a lot of small ball lineups with a 6’5 Pj Tucker at center.
My top 3 are
1. Jokic
2. AD

"You can look at years where maybe one Conference was stacked af, but I don't remember the last time so many teams were enjoyable to watch imo and even if they're not going anywhere are worthwhile and dangerous on paper any given night. 

**The West:** Obviously the Clippers, Lakers, Jazz, Warriors, Blazers, Mavericks, Rockets(with Harden), Nuggets are good watchable teams in the West. The Suns have a really good crew this year too though with CP3/Booker/Mikal/Ayton etc. Obviously the Pelicans are a big attraction with playoff hopes. No one has the Wolves in the running, but a team on paper with DLo, Beasley, Rubio, KAT, Culver, and #1 pick AntEdwards is worth watching. I'd look forward to my Sixers playing them to see those guys, they have two stars and a potential third. The Kings and Spurs aren't *bad*, they have good watchable and interesting players, and when Morant and JJJ returns the Grizzlies are certainly a fun young team. The only team left out is the tanking OKC who at least is interesting in the long run with their haul of picks. That's the entire conference. 

**The East:** We're used to a stacked West, but the East is where things really change. Again, Sixers, Pacers, Celtics, Bucks, Heat, Nets were all obvious standout teams in the Conference. That being said, Orlando made the playoffs last year and is off to a good start, and the Cavs actually have an intriguing rotation with Sexland/Okoro/Love/Drummond and guys like KPJ/Cedi/Nance/McGee as well. I think the Hawks have a legit squad there, they look 10 deep to me when healthy with a young(get it) superstar to lead the way. The Hornets have Rozier/Graham/Hayward/Bridges in the starting 5 and LeMelo is a treat off-the-bench. The Bulls have Zach and Coby making an exciting backcourt, a high pick in PatWill, Lauri, Wendell, etc. The Wizards have a backcourt that can kill you any given night with Rui, Deni, Bertans, Thomas Bryant, etc. They aren't elite teams, but they're certainly watchable and they're not a joke imo. Toronto is struggling, but I'll still give them time to bounce back. They certainly have good players. I've covered everyone except the Knicks who are off to a good start, and Detroit is clearly tanking. I won't pass any judgement on the Knicks yet, but that's 13/15 teams I can confidently look at and like. 

When was the last time in the league where even if I'm being personally picky can look at let's say 25/30 teams and say they have good talent and are truly worth watching? I love where the NBA is at right now, I think so many fans have a reason to be excited about their teams. Almost no game feels like a free win coming into it. I personally really hope the league doesn't expand, because this is special.",Talent Distribution in the League is the BEST it's been in years
"Since guys like Pau Gasol and Tyson Chandler aren’t on a roster, that leaves LeBron, Melo, Korver, and Udonis Haslem as the only players that have been in the league since 2003. And because LeBron was taken 1st overall in the draft ahead of Melo and Korver,  and Haslem wasn’t signed until August, technically LeBron has been here longer than anyone else.

"Obviously, the chances of either one of these individuals making it to the NBA is astronomically low, but I thought this would be a fun post. And G-league counts as ""making it"" in the NBA in this case. 

Julian Newman was ""hyped"" to be a type of scoring phenom, and played against varsity basketball players when he was just in fifth grade. He has a good amount of games of scoring a ton of points, but is quite the selfish player. Moreover, he is listed at just 5 foot 7 inches tall, and that even seems generous.

Rapper Sheck Wes played in basketball but didn't go to college. Despite that, he declared for the 2020 draft and no team picked him up. He's just 6 foot 2 inches tall, but still was able to sign for Paris Basketball in LND Pro B, which is a second tier professional basketball league in France. I couldn't find many videos of him balling, but apparently he's somewhat decentish.

"Snippets from a new interview with Bogdan:

&gt; “When the news (of the alleged Bucks-Kings deal) came out, we were like, ‘What the fuck?’” Bogdanovic said during a half-hour phone conversation with The Athletic last week. “I didn’t know what was going on. I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure what was going on.”

&gt; ...while Bogdanovic didn’t clarify much about the Bucks’ involvement and why they appeared to believe he was willing to come their way, he made two other strong viewpoints very clear: **The idea that Antetokounmpo recruited him hard directly was overblown, and he wasn’t pleased at how the Kings be-traded him along the way**

&gt;Yes, you read that right. And in a weird sort of way, Bogdanovic’s made-up word made perfect sense.

&gt; “It’s not the part that you were traded (that bothered him),” he said. “But it’s more like you feel a little be-traded. No one let you know about it.”

&gt; ""I remember (the Kings) called me right after they were talking with Vlade — bla bla — and they said, ‘We still want to be the same team, we still want you to (be on the team). You’re a big piece of it, you’re a big part of it.’ Bla, bla, bla. ‘We want to keep you,’ and all those stories. You know, it just caught me off guard, really.

&gt; When someone breaks that trust level, when someone does that, from that point you don’t believe them anymore, you know?""

&amp;#x200B;

Curry can’t take 31 shots and attempt 19 free throws every game like he did on Sunday, but the Warriors do need him to dominate the ball more than he did in their first five games. Before Sunday, Curry touched the ball in the half court 31 times per 36 minutes, a lower rate than any season since Mark Jackson was still the head coach in 2013-14, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Even his brother, Seth Curry, averaged more half-court touches (33.2), as did 86 other players. That changed on Sunday, as Curry set season highs in total touches (88), half-court touches (44), and time possessing the ball (6.6 minutes).

The Warriors won’t and shouldn’t have Curry do his best James Harden impression by running countless pick-and-rolls and isolations. Taking on such a massive workload wouldn’t be wise for a 32-year-old with a lot of miles on his 6-foot-3, 185-pound body. But they do need a higher-usage version of Curry more often. This would mean having him serve as more of an on-ball creator, while balancing that role with his off-ball brilliance.",Stephen Curry was only averaging 31 touches per game on offense *(before 62 pt game) - less then Seth

"Context:

&gt;**So with the Milwaukee situation, what was your experience and your side of that whole situation?**

&gt; just couldn’t believe everything was happening like that, you know? Nothing was in my hands, really. When I saw that tweet about the Milwaukee stuff, I really saw it on Twitter. It’s not bullshit. That’s why I felt caught off guard.

&gt;(Before free agency, and soon after the Kings fired former general manager Divac in mid-August), I remember (the Kings) called me right after they were talking with Vlade — bla bla — and they said, ‘We still want to be the same team, we still want you to (be on the team). You’re a big piece of it, you’re a big part of it.’ Bla, bla, bla. ‘We want to keep you,’ and all those stories. You know, it just caught me off guard, really.

&gt;When someone breaks that trust level, when someone does that, from that point you don’t believe them anymore, you know? I think it was unfair a little bit because I didn’t even get a call or nothing (from the Kings) and it was 2 a.m. in my country (when the news broke). I was just confused. I remember waking up the next morning, seeing my phone just blowing up. ‘What was happening? What happened?’ Bla, bla, bla. Ah, you got traded to Milwaukee. I said, ‘Like, how can I get traded (when he’s a restricted free agent)?’

&gt;My agent was explaining the whole summer (that in) restricted free agency, we’re waiting for offers and that’s it, you know? If the Kings don’t want to give us a good offer, (or) they offer me the same money they offered me the last time and they didn’t want to go more than that, or they want me to check the market (that’s fine). They’d talked to my agent about checking the market, and I was fine. And then, that was the deal with the Kings. That’s what my agent told me. And I talked personally with them as well.

&gt;**So if I’m hearing you right, did you stop thinking about Milwaukee at that point because the league seemed determine to make sure that didn’t happen?**

&gt;Yeah, honestly, I didn’t even make a decision about it. It was three days where something is happening and I didn’t even decide nothing, you know? I wasn’t even involved. I wasn’t even involved, and it’s about me — which is crazy.

"For teams, it's the ultimate get out of jail free card in that they don't have to trade assets or pay off the rest of their contracts in the event of buyout or amnesty. For expansion teams, their incentive to get decent players since they're just starting up.

The obvious one for me off the bat is Kevin Love. The Cavs would have to trade draft picks and young players in order to trade Kevin Love. I don't think you can get anything of value for Kevin Love at this point in time. I still think he's a good player but I don't know if he's worth the 30 million that he's making at this point in time.

Al Horford has a good chance of not getting protected. The Thunder have somehow found a way to get first round picks in any circumstance. I just don't know why a team would trade for Al Horford at this point in time due to his age.

Another one is probably John Wall. It really depends on where the Rockets are at that point in time. If Harden is traded and they're rebuilding, Wall could be gone. Most of it depends on how they want to build their roster going forward.

Tobias Harris is a possible candidate. I think Tobi is good but they're basically paying LeBron money for a borderline All-Star in the East. Philly could just use the expansion draft as a way to create cap space to get more depth if needed. This one really hinges on whether Philly believes they can get something of value for him in a trade.

If the Clippers don't get past the second round again, Marcus Morris might not get protected. Marcus Morris is a decent player but paying him $16 million every year until he's 35 feels like an overpay.

"Is there any good reason why it wouldn't be a good idea to only award FTs to attempts that make it to the rim or if the player is tied up at the rim after a clear path or something.

This way, we don't have to change the way in which offensive players use FTs for efficiency, but it will disincentivize the really blatant shot fake 3pt fouls where the shooter literally jumps into the flying defender and flails the ball 20ft away from the rim.

"I feel like this is like the Leborn (Jokic) vs. MJ (AD) question, except Jokic doesn't play defense, but he's this elite offensive player that makes his teammates better. So if you're starting from scratch, Jokic seems like the best option. AD is an elite scorer and defender, but isn't a good playmaker. So I would probably take AD in situations where there are elite or mlutiple playmakers on a team, and Jokic otherwise.",Who would you rather have? Jokic or AD?

&gt; Yet while Bogdanovic didn’t clarify much about the Bucks’ involvement and why they appeared to believe he was willing to come their way, he made two other strong viewpoints very clear: The idea that Antetokounmpo recruited him hard directly was overblown, and he wasn’t pleased at how the Kings be-traded him along the way.

&gt; **We (Thanasis and Bogdanovic) are friends. We are friends, you know? I talked with him once monthly, once every two months. So we talk about it — we talked maybe in the bubble, not about me coming there, nothing like that. But we were like, ‘Ah, you guys are good,’ — bla, bla, bla, you know? Normal things. How is your family? Basketball things, we didn’t even talk about it because I know that they are professionals and they respect my professionalism and we never talked about it. We really never talked about it. When the news came out, we were like, ‘What the fuck?’ I didn’t know what was going on. I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure what was going on.**

"Basically the title. I was on basketball reference when I noticed that, and found it super odd. I think all-star has positional requirements, so how could he possibly not be an all-star but make an all-nba team?

"First of all keep in mind this is coming from  the perspective of a greedy Sixers fan who wants to steal Kyle Lowry. That being said...

&amp;#x200B;

This is the perfect year to take a gap year for Toronto. There are basically no fans this year, and on top of that the Raptors are playing in Tampa f\*\*\*ing Bay. I can't imagine this is a fun season for any of the players, especially those with homes in Toronto. It's not fair for them but I wouldn't be surprised if some players would rather get this season over with before the playoffs anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Toronto has a promising young core. Fred, OG, Pascal (who I still believe in) are all locked up for the long haul. Why not get a chance to draft a superstar with a top 5 pick in a loaded draft? I don't even remember the last time Toronto was in the lottery (which is a compliment.)

"With expansion seeming more and more imminent by the day due to the losses the NBA needs to make up as a result of the pandemic, it is interesting to think about how the NBA will restructure after potential expansion. I've seen a good amount of proposals for realignment, but I believe this plan makes the most sense in terms of travel and historical precedent. This is of course assuming that the cities chosen are Seattle and Las Vegas, which I believe to be, by far, the most likely cities to get a team. Any other city is a long shot and would have to replace Las Vegas. 

The proposal involves 4 divisions of 8 teams in the traditional Western and Eastern Conferences and returns the NBA to a pre-2004 structure. The playoffs would be structured also like pre-2004 in which the division winners take the top 2 seeds, with the next 6 teams being ranked by their record. This gives meaning to the divisions along with encouraging divisional rivalries, which is something that is currently lacking in the NBA. This system also ensures that if the two best teams in a conference are in the same division, they will still have the opportunity to meet in the Conference Finals. The only downside, at least in the first couple seasons, is that both expansion franchises would be in the same division, but this is unavoidable unless Las Vegas is replaced with a city such as Montreal or Louisville.

My idea for the schedule is that each team would play 5 games against all 7 teams in their division (35 games), 4 games against 7 teams in the other conference division and 3 games against the remaining team in that division (31 games), and only 1 game against each team in the other conference (16 games), for the same normal 82 games that the league will never relinquish because of revenue. I'm 99% sure this idea would never be implemented but it's still an interesting concept that would really turn up the heat with divisional rivalries. 5 games against divisional foes would allow for 2 two-game mini-series plus a final meeting for each matchup during the regular season, which ensures that there would be a regular season ""winner"" for each matchup. These 5th games could all take place at the end of the season to make tiebreakers and division title races that much more intense, similar to how the NFL does it at the end of their seasons. I think the best part about this, however, is that it would decrease overall travel, which would better the quality of play and (maybe) decrease the amount of injuries we see.

# Pacific Division (Western Conference)

*This division is the Pacific Division of the pre-2004 NBA along with the addition of Las Vegas. It restores some old divisional rivalries that were broken up by realignment in 2004 such as Lakers-Blazers along with restoring the late 60s expansion trio of Seattle-Phoenix-Portland, who all 3 had multiple classic playoff series between each other during the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Finally, Las Vegas can form a desert rivalry with Phoenix and possibly an I-15 rivalry with the LA teams as well.*

# Southwest Division (Western Conference)

*This is the spiritual successor to the original Midwest Division that existed for 34 years, that pulls every team from the current Southwest Division plus 3 teams from the Northwest that are geographically Southwest. OKC finally is with the teams that they have had memorable playoff series with such as Houston, San Antonio, and Memphis. With Utah moving into this division, it keeps the possbility for a real Jazz-Nuggets rivalry along with strengthening the hatred between Jazz and Rockets fans. Travel would be a bit long from places like New Orleans/Memphis to Utah, but the historical precedent is there for Utah to be in this division (they were in the Midwest from 1979-2004) and New Orleans/Memphis will still have OKC and the Texas teams as close cities.*

# Central Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Central Division of the 90s minus Toronto and plus Minnesota, which will make travel far less tedious for the Timberwolves. This gives them the opprotunity to develop rivalries with teams that actually make sense for them, possibily mirroring NFC North rivalries. Charlotte and Atlanta may not make too much sense in terms of travel for this division, but both were in this division throughout the 90s with Atlanta going as far back as 1970. In my opinion, this historical precedent outweights removing a team like Toronto from the Atlantic and putting them here, given the great playoff series the Raptors have had with current divisional rivals (BOS, PHI) in recent years.*

# Atlantic Division (Eastern Conference)

*This is the same Atlantic Division pre-2004 with the addition of the Raptors. I don't think breaking up the Southeast Division is too big of a deal given that Atlanta doesn't really have animosity towards Miami or Orlando that I know of. This also re-introduces the possbility for another Heat-Knicks rivalry one day which would be great for the league.*

Ultimately, this turned out to be a legendary performance. Some of you may remember back when the Western Conference really *did* make it impossible for you to succeed. The San Antonio Spurs were just as good as that extraordinary Kobe-Shaq Lakers team in some ways and also one of the best teams in the league for more than a decade. That ultra gritty, slowly grind your spirit into the ground type of culture was fueled by Duncan, Parker, and Ginobli, but was captained by a prime Gregg Popovich. They happened to come up against the Phoenix Suns in the 2010 playoffs and it would be no easy task, especially at the end of Game 3.

I’ve been considering many different people for this designation, but have decided based on a combination of factors that this honor belongs to **Khem Birch**. 

I first learned this person existed close to the trade deadline last season. Upon further research, I’ve found that his entirely uninspiring numbers and limited role on a seldom-watched team have resulted in Khem Birch generating almost zero buzz over his flavorless four year career. I would wager that he has the least name recognition of any player in the league that actually sees minutes. 

Can anyone top the obscurity of the elusive Khem Birch?",Who is the most random/obscure player currently in the NBA?
"I haven't watched too many Jazz games, but from what I've heard from Jazz fans and my limited time watching him, it seems he provides

* Good screens leading to good shots 

* Good rim running and lob finishing

How is he as a passer? As a post scorer? General scorer?",Some questions about the offensive value Rudy Gobert provides
"I got:

1) Magic  
2) Curry  
3) Oscar   
4) CP3  
5) Stockton
6) Nash
7) Isiah
8) Westbrook 
9) Kidd
10) Payton

So for me he’s comfortably in that top 10, slotting in at #8. 

What about you guys?",Is Russell Westbrook a top 10 PG All-Time?
"This is what sets him apart from the rest. Other guards in the league get a lot of their points from the line because they try to create contact, or blatantly flop, and random ticky tack 3 pt fouls. Kyrie gets his points through pure skill. This is how some players get inflated regular season stats and meaningless MVPs that disappear in the postseason. Kyrie is the one who hits clutch shots in game 7 and plays winning playoff basketball.",Why does nobody mention that Kyrie gets almost all of his points without free throws?
The dude definitely was complaining too much for my liking tonight but he played amazingly with the 6 3s. Was the only reason we had a chance to tie the game at the end. He also had 5 fouls that he definitely needs to cut down on. no tricking occurred today though.,Patrick Beverley tonight versus the spurs: 20 points 7/10 FG 6 threes 8 assists 8 rebounds 2 blocks.
"I was watching the Brooklyn home stream for the Nets-Jazz game and wasn't paying too much attention during the intros but I happened to glance up and notice that the Nets need to have someone looking over their intro videos because they misspelled Taurean Prince's name, instead spelling it [""Taurena Prince"".](https://i.imgur.com/nAzEtlG.gifv) Not a good way to start the game, Nets.",During the Nets intro videos for their players they misspelled Taurean Prince's name
I know he got 5 all-nba defense selections but I never got to see him play. he leads everyone in steals by a mile but steals don’t always tell the whole picture. Iverson lead the league in steals 4 times but nobody says he was a great defender. Was he mostly about team defense or could he actually guard guys? How good on defense would he be in today’s league?,How good of a defender was John Stockton?
"&gt;FROM ELIAS: Last night was the 39th time Luka Doncic led the Mavericks in pts, rebs and ast (including ties). That is now the most in team history, passing Dirk Nowitzki who did that 38 times. It took Luka less than 10 percent of the time it took Dirk to get that total &amp; more.

"Prior to Moses Malone's death in 2015, Wilt Chamberlain was the only MVP to have died. Since then, we've lost Moses, Kobe and Unseld in the span of 5 years. We lost as many MVPs in 2020 as we had in the 64 years prior to that.","Since the inception of the MVP award in 1956 up until 2015, only one player who had won the award passed away."
"Hi guys, I wanna ask about NBA standings.

I know about the tiebreakers when the regular season ends and how they determine who’s gonna make it to playoff. 

What I wanna ask is: How do they rank teams who have the same W-L record when the regular season is still going? For example, in the Western Conference, there are currently 5 teams with 3-4 record, how do they rank these teams? Are there any criteria or they just put whoever get the record first on top?

I know this is super temporary and subject to change very soon after a few more games, and it does not matter that much at the beginning of the season (like now). But still I’m curious and I really want to know. I tried a Google search but all of the results seem to be end-season/playoff criteria.

Thank you guys. Enjoy the games.",How do NBA standings work while in season?

Knicks are honestly looking really good. Now that they have a real coach RJ is developing into a better player. Have high hopes from the #3 pick of last years draft! Randle is showing that potential he had with the Pels. Knicks have been fun to watch.,RJ Barrett posts 26/11/5 and Julius Randle with 28/16/9 in a W over the Hawks!
"I think it’s his 3pt winner vs the Magic in “09 playoffs.

The other option was his game winning drive vs Detroit in his epic 48 pt playoff game. 

Am I missing an obvious one?","Besides the block on Iggy, what single play will Lebron be best remembered?"

Absolutely protected:
DJ

Vassell
Keldon

Patty
Lonnie

"With all the talk of new expansion teams, how exactly does the 'protect certain players,' get others vultured to new teams thing work?",How do expansion drafts work?
Hi guys ! Do you think Kawhi Leonard and Paul George will be playing against the Warriors ? It's a back-to-back so I'm not sure.,Kawhi and George playing vs. Warriors
Say the NBA adds Seattle and Las Vegas to the league and they have an Expansion Draft to fill out those rosters. What would you as a fan do?,"Hypothetical: If the NBA has an expansion tomorrow and your team can only protect seven players on the roster in the Expansion draft, which seven would you want them to protect?"
"Celtics rookie coming out here for possibly a dark horse candidate in the ROTY campaign? He's been absolutely solid and balling out. I can see him getting a solid 18+ mpg with us even with Kemba back in.

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267257",Celtics Rookie Payton Pritchard tonight vs. the Raptors: 23 PTS | 2 REB | 8 AST | 8/13 FG | 2/4 3PT | +18 in 32 mins
"That draft class was the 1970 class, which included the legends **Bob Lanier**, **Pete Maravich**, **Geoff Petrie**, and **Dan Issel**.

Surprisingly enough, this draft class followed the year when Kareem-Abdul Jabber got drafted, so true situational irony where the the best offensive draft-class occurred after arguably the GOAT. 

Other years with multiple 20+ ppg scorers:

Year | Players 
:- | :-
1960 | Oscar Robertson, Jerry West 
1965 | Rick Barry, Billy Cunningham
1966 | Dave Bing, Lou Hudson
1970 | Pete Maravich, Bob Lanier, Geoff Petrie, Dan Issel
1972 | Julius Erving, Bob McAdoo
1974 | George Gervin, John Drew
1975 | David Thompson, World B Free
1976 | Alex English, Adrian Dantley
1977 | Marques Johnson, Bernard King
1984 | Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley
**Lottery Era** | **Players**
1985 | Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone
1996 | Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson

Not many surprising names on there, but it is surprising there are only two draft classes to produce more than 2 20+ ppg scorers.  It’s also surprising how after the lottery was introduced, everything changed to such an extent. It’s pretty mind-boggling.

Also keep in mind there’s many players right now who would fit these categories, but I decided to leave them off because their careers are not finished yet.

Something else that’s interesting is **1950-1953, 1954, 1957, 1963, 1964, 1967, 1971, 1979-1981, 1986, 1989-1991, 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2002** were the draft classes that didn’t produce *any* career 20+ ppg scorers. There were multiple with only one player, like 1992 with Shaquille O’ Neal.","[OC] From 1949-2003, Only 1 Draft-Class Produced More Than 3 Career 20+ PPG Scorers"

"I’m watching the Minnesota game and Denver just committed some sort of violation. I didn’t know what it was because I didn’t hear the whistle, I only saw the Denver players complaining in in unison and the ball switched sides.

I also noticed this happening sometimes in the Nets game, where I had to judge based off the player’s reactions, not the whistle.

Is this happening to anyone else? Might be because the synthetic crowd noises and music on the court are crazy loud.",Are the referees audible?
"If Seattle gets a team what does that mean for record books? And can they be named SONICS?

With Okc still in league, anyone have a good guess or a real answer on what would happen?

I think they would have to change their name and not be considered champions. I’m from Oregon would be great to get the PNW rivalry going. 

Thanks in advance",If Seattle gets a team what would that mean for the record books.
"As a new fan, I find it difficult to enjoy games and therefore feel less likely to watch future games. After watching the NBA for around 6 months, I find it very difficult to enjoy the game when I feel like the rules are arbitrary and difficult to understand in real-time.

I started watching the NBA after getting laid off from my banking job soon after the bubble restart. While I quickly picked up another job, I found that I wouldn't start until April and therefore had a significant amount of time for new hobbies. I quickly dove into the NBA and NHL to fill what previously was 100+ hour work weeks, watching every game I could and trying to understand as much as possible. 

Over the last 6 months, I have thoroughly enjoyed the bubble format of the NBA. The Lakers became my favorite team because of their lockdown defense (I'm currently enjoying watching the sixers more) and I went from illegally streaming games to paying for league pass.

However, I've come to a point where I feel like I should really understand what is a foul and what isn't, but being completely surprised 30-50% of the time a whistle is blown. The problem is two-fold. First, NBA broadcasts rarely show replays of fouls. While I understand there is significant fluidity to the game, it makes it difficult as a fan to come to see what is going on at a speed that I can digest it. Also, it makes it difficult to learn and understand the game as a fan. In contrast, the NHL shows replays of almost every penalty, and while there are still controversies, I feel like I can get a better understanding of the game and that rules are more fairly applied.

Tonight I had significant difficulty understanding and watching the lakers/grizzlies games due to the aforementioned issues. As a new fan, I find these incongruencies frustrating and am looking forward to the NHL start as a replacement for the NBA product.","The NBA product as a new fan, and why fouls are frustrating"
"Last night, I was watching the second half of the Pacers Pelicans game and I noticed something small I wanted to write about - I saw that the Pelicans’ closing lineup (Ball/Redick/Ingram/Williamson/Adams) ran a specific set a few times in order to get Ingram the ball in a position he likes. It looks like they start in a [box set](https://i.imgur.com/1cVZInN.jpg). Notice that **Ingram** is on the left low block and **Adams** is on the left elbow.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a [video](https://streamable.com/01zdc7) showing the 3 plays they ran out of this set.

&amp;nbsp;

To get into the box set, Lonzo brings the ball up, usually either down the middle or left side of the court. Adams goes to the left elbow, sets a back screen for Ingram who cuts to the left block. Then, Adams sets a down screen for Ingram, who comes off the screen ready to catch the ball on the left wing facing the basket (the videos show the action a lot better than my description). 

This action usually flows into an Ingram/Adams pick-and-roll on the left wing, or just an Ingram isolation. The unsung part of the play that really makes it work (in my opinion) is the way that the two other players, JJ Redick and Zion, are used. They usually don’t do much besides maybe screening for each other (to get Zion an easy dive to the rim or Redick a 3), but the threat of a Redick catch-and-shoot 3 or a Zion lob causes defenders to be more wary of them and prevents them from sending too much defensive attention to Ingram.

It seems like the best way to guard this is by using Lonzo’s man to dig down while Ingram has the ball and this could possibly blow up the pick and roll with Adams.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my summary of the three examples of the play in action during yesterday’s crunch time possessions:

&amp;nbsp;

[Possession 1](https://streamable.com/7r1jgz)

[Possession 2](https://streamable.com/vnv5lw)

[Possession 3](https://streamable.com/3madve)

&amp;nbsp;

In the first possession, the play flows into an Ingram/Adams PnR and Sabonis (Adams’ man) drops back to cover the Adams roll, Brogdon is caught up a little on the screen and neither man can credibly contest Ingram’s pull up jumper in the paint. Both McDermott and Sampson keep a careful watch on their own assignments and are unable to help much. Notably, McConnell (Lonzo’s man) is mostly out of the play. Result: **Ingram 2 pt basket on open paint jumper.**

&amp;nbsp;

In the second possession, the play again flows into the PnR action, and Brogdon is again slowed down by Adams’ excellent (totally not moving) screen. Adams’ man, this time Myles Turner, hedges to prevent the Ingram open 3, Ingram reads the play excellently and hits Adams on a dive to the rim. Notice that Justin Holiday (Lonzo’s man) digs down but since Turner is out of position Holiday and Sabonis can’t get there to help in time. Result: **Steven Adams dunk off pass from Ingram**

&amp;nbsp;

The third possession is an example of the play getting blown up. Lonzo’s man (Oladipo this time) digs down again as Ingram has the ball, but Adams decides not to set the screen (not exactly sure why) to give Ingram an isolation look with Brogdon. However, Adams’ man (Turner) is in an excellent position to wall Ingram off from the basket and then Oladipo’s positioning comes in handy once Ingram tries to go the other way. Brogdon does a great job of containing Ingram with the help of his teammates here. Result: **Ingram misses contested midrange jumper**",[OC] Pelicans late game offense: Using a box set to strengthen the Ingram/Adams two man game
"This is one aspect of his game I have wanted to monitor, considering how mediocre he was from three point range at UGA (29% on 8 attempts per game).  

Early returns are.... well basically what you would expect.  Dude needs to dial it back a notch with this Westbrook-esque bricklaying .","Anthony ""A1"" Edwards 3pt shooting this season: 29% on 6 attempts per game"
"Title explains itself

 Mines include 

Both Damian lillard buzzer beaters against Houston and OKC

Curry vs Okc 2016 

Kawhi Leonard's 2019 against the 76ers 

Jordan's 1989 buzzer beater vs the cavs 

Kobe 2009 vs D wade and the miami heat 

Theres alot more to cover and I cannot list them all 

What is yours?

Edit: I forgot Drose against Cleveland 2015

Edit II: last second shots count also idc",What is the best buzzer beaters in your opinion?
So Lou averages 52% FG when he makes the first shot and just 32% when he misses the first shot which is just absolutely insane. Does this theory apply to other players as well?,Is the lou Williams first shot theory real for other players too?
"He's legitimately been playing like a top 20 player for about the last 3 seasons, was an allstar in 2018 and should have been in 2019 (over Sabonis imo) and is probably the only reason Orlando hasn't been in the lottery the past 3 years. Orlando won't be bad this year that they would trade him and the Jrue Holiday trade probably upped his value because he has more term and is a better player which another team probably wont wanna pay the price. Its crazy the shift he had from an above average center from 2012 to 2017 to maybe the 4th best (after Embiid, Jokic, Gobert , and KAT in no particular order).",Is Nikola Vucevic the most underrated player in the nba?

"I was beginning to work my night ""shift"" and I was set to watch Nets vs Jazz, but I decided to switch to Lakers vs Grizzlies because of the commentator and play by play. He used to be the lead commentator on NBA and NFL on our ESPN (I'm from Brazil), now he's on another channel, but still on a NBA task. I usually don't pick a game just because of broadcasting in Portuguese, but whenever he is on the booth, I pick that game.

Do you have a favorite broadcast crew that you follow, no matter the game? Or vice versa, a crew that you hate so much that you skip every possible game with them on the booth, or just downright mute the broadcast?",Have you ever watched a game just because of the broadcast crew?
"Whether it be at some point this season, the playoffs, or the early part of next season, im just wondering how long the NBA is going to have empty arenas. What do you say?",Buy or Sell: We will see full NBA arenas again in 2021?
"He’s definitely regressed from 2016, but he is the absolute king of the little things that makes life much easier for Steph. Can run Kerrs offense which allows Steph to run off screens all day. Still a good defender and solid rebounder. Definitely still a solid player and Great rebounder for his size, and also can run plays for the warriors.",Draymond Green makes everyone on the Warriors so much better on both ends of the floor
"Been trying to find this out for about a year. They play it during intros, commercial breaks, etc. What song is it? I can't Shazam it because they're usually talking over it

Edit: Found it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXRCl3CR9v0",What's that rock music they use on NBA TV a lot? They just used it while talking about the Lakers

"Helped lead a comeback victory over the Hawks. I'm excited about this team, it seems like we have a lot of good young talent.",Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley played the entire fourth quarter tonight and finished with 16 points on 4/7 shooting from the field and 2/3 from 3
"He’s been out even during the pre season with “knee soreness” but to be out that long with that injury title is kinda weird. 

Batum has stepped up in his absence getting starter minutes but I assume he heads to the bench once Morris comes back (no way they payed him 16M to come off the bench) which could ruin his rhythm

It’s early but Batum looks like a better fit with Kawhi and PG so Ty Lue will have some decisions to make",So what happened to Marcus Morris?
"[Link to Gobert's response](https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/1346138503319576576?s=20)
In light of Shaq claiming he would destroy him in his [Instagram post](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eq5m7bGUcAIP7fl?format=jpg&amp;name=large), Rudy Gobert has been getting pretty unnecessary hate from many people on social media, safe to say, he's pretty overhated at the moment as a result of his large contract. I don't think its unreasonable to call him overpaid, but I wouldn't fault a player for accepting that kind of money.","Rudy Gobert responding to the Shaq ""beef"" on Twitter: ""There is no beef. If people wanna keep speaking negatively about me or keep discrediting what i do it’s on them and all that does is show who they are. I will always be happy for a brother beating the odds. And i’m gonna keep beating the odds."""
"Personally I believe Wilt and Bird come in as the next players who could earn this title, with Duncan and Magic slightly behind those 2, but i'm curious to see who your runner ups to the GOAT debate are behind the big 3.","Besides Jordan, Kareem, and Lebron, who do you think has the best case for GOAT?"
"If Raptors decide to tank for a season, who can give the raptors a good package for Lowry? Shams has stated that the market for Lowry is good and raptors can get a good value for him..",Realistic Trade offers for Kyle Lowry?
"Just curious what everyone has to say. Thought this would be a fun little idea for some discussion. Let me know who would you buy and  sell stock in!

I’m a long term Knicks stockholder so I’d definitely be adding more Knicks stock to make up for years of losses!",Let’s say all NBA teams are stocks. What are some teams you’d buy stock in for the next 5 years and some teams you’d sell stock in?
"[Posted this on his IG story about an hour ago.](https://i.imgur.com/JOeQiW7.jpg)

Tob slander permanently cancelled.",Tobias Harris confirmed to at least be aware of r/Sixers
"Jaylen Brown has remarkably improved on his game every season thus far, and it doesn't look like it's gonna stop anytime soon. After playing sub-star level last season and then playing like a star in the playoffs, he seems to have fully established himself as a star in the league this season thus far.

Ben Simmons has barely improved on offense in any meaningful way 4 years in the league, but his defense has improved to a perennial all-defense and fringe DPOY caliber player. Unlikely he improves much on his offense going forward after little improvement in 4 years. 

Who do you think will be regarded as the better player at the end of this season?",Who do you think will be regarded as a better player after this season: Jaylen Brown or Ben Simmons

"In the NBA draft we see a lot of raw, unpolished talent selected high in the draft because they have the potential to get better at the game when they get some experience and NBA training instead of being expected to be a solid contributor from their first season and get better.

In my opinion, some examples of project players in recent drafts are guys like Aleksej Pokusevski, who are expected to become starting caliber players in some years. 

So, according to you, who is a ""project"" who panned out?

Edit: /uBlankVoid2979 explained it better, saying ""A project is someone with high potential but they're very raw and are not very good at the time of the draft"".","Since the year 2000, which draft picks regarded as ""projects"" panned out?"

Just based off experience and knowing what they're capable of doing. They've seen it all in the last 6 years. They have nothing to fear whereas a team like the Clippers have everything to prove. I would not want to play them in the first or second round even if they were a low seed. They have less expectations and less pressure to win but they're gonna bring that same intensity like they do in the past even if they aren't as good. I would treat them the same as if they were still that 73-9 team.  I feel they would have the psychological advantage over most teams. Just the fear of what Curry can do is enough to make you doubt yourself.,Are the Warriors a low key threat if they make the playoffs as a low seed?

"I feel like there hasn't been a nationally televised game on TNT, ESPN or ABC since like Christmas. What's up with that? I don't get NBATV so I've only been able to watch my local team's games, which sucks, and I feel like if I drop $60 for NBATV streaming then all of a sudden all the games I want to watch will be on TNT or ESPN again.",Why no national games outside of NBATV?
"It is not an easy decision due to how much the game has changed and how much guards are expected to score and shoot now. 

Out of these who would you take over Stockton: Dame, Trae, Harden, Luka, Steph, Kyrie, Westbrook.

CP3 is close to stockton's playstile so he is a case of which player you prefer and not which playstyle you prefer.

What is your prefered playstyle for your PG? What traits would you look for in your PG for the modern NBA?","Who would you rather have for your team: Stockton a pass first traditional PG elite on both ends, or a modern day score first PG that might not be as good defensively?"
Thunder lost 2 all stars for Paul George. It seemed like a cradle robbery at the time but now looking back pg left soon and Dipo/Sabonis are all stars. Do the thunder do the same move now? George is the best player of the 3 but 2 all stars &gt; 1.,"If Thunder knew about Sabonis and Dipo development, would it still be a good move to get Paul George?"
"Title pretty much says it all. What moments in NBA history do you feel are under appreciated, whether it be a game, trade, signing, or a stretch of games.

For me it’s Jimmy Butler in the 2020 NBA finals. Particularly games 3 and 5. It was special for me because it wasn’t a product of supernova shooting like Lillard and Harden are one to produce, or spurred on by supreme athletic dominance like Giannis. Hell, even though Jimmy’s a smart player, he wasn’t even outsmarting the other team (ie. LeBron, Jokic, CP3). He was just willing his team to victory in a way I’ve never really seen. It’s cliche, but this is the ultimate example of wanting it most (not that LeBron and the Lakers didn’t want it). It was made all the more powerful by game 6 where it was clear he was a dead man walking. You can even see in the start of this season that he really gave every ounce of himself to win those games.

Also, for a one game example, my favorite underrated game is Kobe dropping 42 in the first half against the Wizards on March 28th, 2003. I was never and still am not exactly a Kobe fan, but it was in my opinion the best half of basketball I’ve ever seen.

Edit: in case it wasn’t clear, it can be recent too, “historical” is honestly just anything before this season.",What are your favorite moments in NBA history that are historically underrated?
"The Spurs still have the narrative of a plodding team, but they played the fastest pace during the bubble.  They are playing uptempo again this year despite playing the majority of their games against some of the slowest in the league (Nola, Utah, LAL twice).

What don't people realize about your team?  I'd like to know the things that the stats, the national broadcaster, or the r/nba frontpage don't tell me.",What specifics of your team are others getting wrong so far this year?
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pokusal01.html. 
  
I know it's harsh to pick on rookies but I'm just hoping to see some answers that can encourage me that this guy won't be a total bust. His body doesn't exactly look NBA ready and the current shooting of 2/21 from the field and 1/16 from three with many misses barely touching the rim is far from promising. I think Jamal Murray started his career 0/16 so that's the best answer to the question I can think of but are there anymore?",[Serious] What are the worst starts to an NBA career in a players first 5 games? Currently Aleksej Pokusevski has recorded 10 turnovers and 5 points on 9/6/- shooting splits in 80 minutes.
Do you y'all think it's fair to compare Zach Lavine to Prime Carter? Same player build and archetype.,Zach Lavine comparable to Vince Carter?
"As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%).

McCollum has made 28-65 of his shots beyond the arc while Nurkic has been 6-14 from the line. 

https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers","As of today, a CJ McCollum 3-pointer (43.1%) is more likely to go in than a Nurkic free throw (42.9%)."
"That's all.

You want more? Terrence Davis is on the outs with the Raptors anyway right? Or better yet, Kyle Lowry could keep them in the playoffs. Meanwhile the Raptors could stand to get rid of one of those two. Not like they're competing this year anyway.","Orlando Magic should trade for Kyle Lowry or Terrence Davis, and Raptors should blow it up."
"I'm just watching the Hawks struggling to score 10 points in a quarter right now and they are actually pathetic. No flow offensively and giving up offensive rebounds for fun. The team has lost to the Cavs, Knicks and should lose comfortably to the Hornets. Just like last season, they are the ultimate pretenders after 3-4 games and will struggle to win 25 games again.  

As for Bogdanovic, the less said about him the better. The Bucks absolutely dodged a bullet. I will give him time to adjust but the guy looks nowhere near a 20m/year player",The Hawks are nowhere near a playoff team and Bogdanovic might be the most overrated free agent signing of the off-season.

Draymond Green 4/6/6 on 33/0/66 shooting and tied for a game worst -11 in 31 minutes tonight. The backpack has yet to be unhitched as Draymond Green continues to struggle to be able to score

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267276",Draymond Green 4/6/6 on 33/0/66 shooting and tied for a game worst -11 in 31 minutes tonight
Whenever I see threads on this subreddut or even articles from ESPN about the best Eastern team at a shot to win the chip it feels like the pacers are almost never mentioned. The starting 5 seems so balanced and with how Sabonis and Oladipo are playing it seems like they could potentially have 2 all star players.  I feel like the team doesn't have a glaring weakness that some of the other contending east teams do.,Are the Pacers the most underrated team in the east?

"Anybody know the rules surrounding the play in tournament and the lottery?

If you make it to the play in as a 9th or 10th seed, win, then reach the playoffs, are you out of the lottery selection? Do you stay at your previous standings position but are just not included in the drawing? Or do you stay locked into both no matter what happens?

"George hill, imo, is the most obvious and likely player who will be traded at the trade deadline this season.
The thunder are clearly in rebuild mode and are in asset accumulation mode and we know how much Presti loves his draft picks.

Hill should be of interest to most contenders because of what he brings to the table as a player, locker room vet, and his contract is great.

Hill’s contract: This season George Hill will make a fully guaranteed  9.5 million dollars which is a good price. However next season Hill is making 10 million dollars with only 1 million guaranteed so if a team doesn’t like his performance, they can waive him without taking a big cap hit. 

Hill as a player: George Hill is known for being an elite shooter and a solid defender. Last season with the Bucks he led the league in 3pt shooting as he shot 46% from deep. This season, he is shooting 43% from 3 which is still great. 
Hill isn’t the best playmaker but he isn’t bad by any means as he’s averaged over 3 assists in the past couple of season while playing under 25 min a game.


I think Hill could help the Nets now that Dinwiddie is out. 
If the Clippers want to move on from Lou Williams, then Hill would be a great replacement.
The Celtics could also use George Hill.

Ultimately, these teams would probably have to add draft capital to entice OKC.

Early on in the season, this dude is averaging 22 points, 11 rebounds, and almost 13 assists. Stats on this level are unsustainable, and the season is young, but does he have a legit shot at being the third player ever to average a triple double over the course of a season? 

The first direction in answering this has to be looking at Westbrook’s run from 2017 until the end of his Thunder tenure. Denver’s performance as a team will likely be one of the biggest factors in wether or not Jokic can accomplish this feat. The limitations of the post Durant-Thunder roster called for Westbrook’s direct involvement every trip down the floor. Not only was he allowed to dominate the ball... they needed him to. Denver’s roster is much better, and they have a legitimate co-star for Jokic who will have the ball in his hands a lot throughout the season, but we’ve already seen the Nuggets heavily lean on their superstar center to start the year. Additionally, if we can be honest with ourselves, Westbrook’s personality surely played a role in this statistical feat, and I don’t think Jokic will care about his stats enough to hunt them out as the season goes down the stretch. With that said, Jokics passing is always in such a flow within the offense, it may not be such a challenge for him.

Look, do I think it will happen, probably not. But I swear I have never seen someone like this guy play basketball. He’s fucking different, and I think an MVP season could be in the cards regardless. Jokic certainly has a chance to make some history in his career, and honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a part of it.",Jokic on triple double watch for the season?
Disastrous offseason for the jazz overpaying 2 borderline all stars to massive deals. The organization will be hamstrung for a long time with these massive deals. What can the jazz do to get out of these awful contracts? Maybe they can give picks to okc and dump these contracts,The jazz are paying donovan mitchell over 30 million a year and he’s shooting 38% from the field
"It feels like cp3 can do anything on a basketball court, from running the PNR, having a money midrange game, deadeye passer, high assist to turnover ratio, and very vocal as well. Also, his defensive instincts are insane, for a guy of his height to guard legit wings/guards in this league in the post is absurb.. who else do you guys feel are underrated in terms of having a complete arsenal?",Is Cp3 underrated in terms of having a complete arsenal both offensively and on defense?
Just seen an article saying something along the lines of James Harden ball hogging and being selfish like A.I was. I'm too young to have had the pleasure of watching Allen Iverson play so I was just wondering if there was truth to that comment?? Was AI a selfish player?,Was A.I a selfish player?
Let's say the offensive team tries to dunk the ball but blows it massively. The ball touches nobody on either side and reaches the backcourt. Can the offensive team grab that ball because it hit the rim?,Is it a backcourt violation if the ball hits the rim but nobody touches it until it reaches the back court?

He plays like he's only 29 years old seriously. Do you think he'll end up playing in 4 different decades? So retiring at the age of 45?,Could Lebron last until 2030?
"The Knicks are currently the 11th best defense by defensive rating, but teams are shooting an unsustainably low 29.5% from three against them. There are a lot of smart people who believe that defenses can't affect how 3 point shooters shoot, there are also a lot of smart people who believe that smart teams know which threes to give up, or contest better. The Celtics, i think, had a low defensive 3pt% for years. 

Nevertheless, here's how teams would look assuming teams shot league average 3pt percentage against them. The formula is taking (Defensive 3pt% - Average 3 pt%)\*(Defensive 3pt attempt rate)\*(100) to get the D rating adjustment. All the data is taken from basketball reference.

"Jamal Murray is [23 years old and 316 days](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/murraja01.html)

This is the same age as Buddy Hield was during his [2nd NBA game on October 28th 2016.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hieldbu01/gamelog/2017/)

These two were constantly debated over who the better prospect was of the two at the draft, [even for a while after the draft](https://www.theringer.com/2017/1/16/16077528/jamal-murray-vs-buddy-hield-191c24ba83f4)

At the time I was pro Jamal because he was younger and around the same skill (plus I’m Canadian), but looking at it now it seems so odd. Also the fact [the media had Buddy’s age wrong](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/sports/buddy-hield-age-sacramento-kings.html) for a while makes this pick look even worse today.","Jamal Murray is now the same age, as Buddy Hields rookie season"

"Ewing, Riley, Starks, Oakley, Spike Lee, Reggie Miller, Michael Jordan, OJ..it all seems so cinematic reading up on it. Seeing Ewing and Oakley standing side by side, menacing, the core of an elite defense..I'd imagine it was a fascinating time to watch them.

EDIT: (A nice little add on to this post). Look through this gettyimages gallery of the time. Knicks, Spurs, Bulls players..celebrities court side. Really just a different time. Definitely worth a quick look through.

"To this day it stills bother me that Tony Parker left The Spurs after spending 18 seasons then ruining his farewell season by joining the hapless Charlotte Hornets.

Wade and Dirk spend their last years in their home team in the same season.

"I think it was Harden's coach last year talking about it. I'm assuming this is like points per possession and Harden's free throw shooting makes him the most efficient of all time?

EDIT: So I remember the coach saying that if you give Jordan and Harden the ball who produces the most points before you give it up.

I'm firmly a Harden hater don't worry about it I just want to understand what the argument is about.

EDITEDIT: So Harden has a higher eFG for many seasons but I'm not sure that was what was being referenced. And my understanding is the weighting changes the figures so it's era dependant(when you account free throws into the equation), but I'm not very knowledgable so...

EDITEDITEDIT: Another I found as I'm learning to use the stat sites is per 100 possessions Harden's highest is 2019 season 48 to Jordan's 46. And TS% .672 to Jordan's .614. It's probably one of these I was looking for.

Unlike MVP/Finals MVP, it actually takes into account the whole season. So I feel it is more grounded in reality when it comes to judging who the best player in the world is. Unfortunately it only dates to 1993, so certain Michael Jordan seasons, Kareem's entire career, and many others all time greats missed out on the opportunity to receive one. Still, I think I personally prefer this award's objectivity over the MVP. I was amazed to find it was so obscure/little talked about.

The Toronto Raptors have already exceeded their number of blown 10+ point leads from last season. Their record last year was 48-4 in such games and is 1-5 now.,An absolutely brutal stat about the Raptors
"A very solid game for Harris in the 76ers blowout versus the hornets, leading the team in scoring by a healthy margin. 22 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists and very efficient from the field (10/16), although he hasn't taken a single free throw the entire game. This is his 4th straight 20 point game, all four games shooting over 50%. He is proving to be a reliable scoring option under his favorite coach, Doc Rivers, as the Sixers improve to a league-best 6-1 record. It is also worth noting that the Sixers had 34 assists on 46 made field goals- great ball movement shown tonight.  
  
I know that this would be an average game for any star in the league (and it is vs the Hornets), but it's worth noting how consistent Tobias has been, and he's finally proving doubters wrong.

"In a theoretical expansion draft incumbent teams my withhold 8 players from the draft. On the surface this might seem like an easy question for most teams but there seems to be a lot of debate on the last spots. What do you all think?

"With the competitive instinct he had as a player he has squandered the Hornets ever since he owned them. Been comfortable sitting around 7th or 8th or just outside the playoffs. The Hornets contracts have been crazy. Overpaying guys like Batum and low balling Kemba. Their coaches are always poor or jmediocre. Whenever they sign ""big names"" it's usually guys way past their prime like Tony Parker or Dwight. Kemba was the only all star they've drafted in last ten years since Jordan has owned the team.

I know Jordan was bitching a few years back when it was Warriors vs Cavs every year in the finals for awhile that the NBA made it to hard on small market teams because of all these other teams scooping up all the big names to create superteams. Maybe it's a lack of money causing him to fail the Hornets? Seems like he should be trying harder than he has because of his ""do anything to win"" mentality from the past.",Why do you think Jordan hasn't been competitive as an owner like he was as a player?
"I know it’s really early in the season but my top 3 surprises are Keldon Johnson, Sabonis, and Christian Wood (Tobi as an honorable mention). I expected all 3 to be good, just not like this.

His stats have not been overly impressive but he’s looked great as a primary ball handler with the bench unit, can create his own offense and is an active defender.

"Solid start to the season for Cam. Feels like people forget how highly he was rated coming out of high school. It was the right decision by Atlanta to keep him in a starting role despite their off-season additions. Still only 21-years old as well, he's got a bright future ahead of him.

Source for the stats - [https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629629/traditional/](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629629/traditional/)",Cam Reddish (the 'other' player in the Luka-Trae trade) through his first 4 games: 13/5/2/2 on 43/38/79 (55.2% TS).

"Luka Doncic tonight against the Denver Nuggets: 38 pts, 9 rebs, 13 asts, 4 steals, and 9 points in overtime to secure the Mavs 

What a game from Luka! shot 13/22 and 2/7 from 3","Luka Doncic tonight against the Denver Nuggets: 38 pts, 9 rebs, 13 asts, 4 steals, and 9 points in overtime to secure the Mavs victory"
"Tim Duncan made a rare podcast appearance on the Real Ones Podcast released today. This is I think his second one after the Road Trippin' Podcast 3 years ago.

In the pod, he also talked about who he modeled his game after, his relationship with Coach Pop, his battles with KG, Dirk and Kobe, player empowerment, his most fulfilling championship (spoiler: 2005 versus the Pistons), his brief coaching stint on the Spurs, and more.

Jokic part is at 58:08

The Joker is a lot of fun to watch. His creativeness, his footwork, his passing - it's a lot of fun to watch."""

"Throughout his first 5 games of this season, Griffin did these:

0 Offensive Boards, 0 Blocks, 0 Dunks, 0 And1. He attempted 65% of his shots behind the 3pt line and only 13.3% of his attempts were from 0-3ft area. His average shot distance this season is... 19.1ft. It's almost high as JJ Redick's career number. 

It's painfully clear that his days of an athletic freak is more than just 'gone'. He just strolls through the court like AI after his retirement. Of course, Griffin is still a savvy guy for his size, at least. Decent shooter with some great handles and playmaking ablilities. Despite his limits, he somehow manages to get 14.2 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 3.6 APG with not-that-dreadful efficiency.

"Honestly, this subreddit has recently gone down the tubes. Essentially a lot of posts in r/nba are about shitting on other players. I know, because I have posted these threads too.

These include Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Patrick Beverly, Kawhi Leonard, etc. Whenever these guys have a bad play, this subreddit is like TMZ and tries to emphasize and amplify the negatives. It just gets tiring and devalues any type of discussion. Comments that generally try to defend these players end up getting shit on and downvoted.

Meanwhile, players who are categorized as ""Heroes"", like LeBron, Luka, and Dame are constantly protected. Legions of defenders for these players. 

It just seems really stupid to me. Why do people feel a need to shit talk some of the greatest athletes in the world?","Would it be fair to say that r/nba categorizes players into ""Heroes"" and ""Villains""?"

One of the most amusing things about watching San Antonio Spurs games to me is watching their coach Gregg Popovich on the sidelines. Somehow, he has not lost his competitive fire at all at age 71 and he remains as spirited as ever toward the refs and his own players. Whenever the cameras cut to him “going Serbian” (in his own words) I’m always curious about what gets him so ticked off. Usually, this is extremely difficult to decipher in the moment. When I watched him fly off the handle late in the 1/5/2021 game between the Spurs and the LA Clippers, I decided to look back at a few plays down the stretch of that game and try to get to the bottom of what had him so angry.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 1

https://streamable.com/mqkme3

In this first clip, Keldon Johnson (no. 3) messes up a switch and doesn’t get to his man (Luke Kennard, no. 5) in time, leading to an open jumper. Although the play does end up in a Clippers turnover after Kennard misses the shot, Pop strikes me more of a process than a results guy and I’m sure defensive execution is something he drills on a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 2

https://streamable.com/rtquxz

The next frustrating breakdown I saw was with about 2:40 left in the 4th, when Lou Williams (no. 23) blows by Johnson for a layup easily with his speed advantage. Demar Derozan (no. 10) is there with the help, but he is a step late and Williams is such a great finisher that there’s not much Derozan can do. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 3

https://streamable.com/npkwyp

The very next play, Johnson and Patty Mills (no. 8) mess up a defensive coverage on the pick and roll and this leads to an open 3 point basket. When Lou Williams sets a ball screen for Kawhi Leonard (no. 2, Johnson’s man), Patty Mills begins guarding Leonard since he thinks the two are supposed to switch the players they are guarding. However, Johnson fights over the screen and stays with Leonard also, leading to Williams popping to the top of the key and nailing the shot. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breakdown 4

https://streamable.com/9363l1

The next defensive possession for the Spurs, Patrick Beverley uses a drag screen from Kawhi Leonard to drive the ball to the hoop and pick up a layup. In this play, Johnson stays with the ball handler (Beverley), but floats a little bit too far to the right, giving Beverley an easy lane to the rim. Johnson’s positioning is probably fine in terms of depth, since at this point in the game Beverley had canned SIX 3-pointers and the Spurs might not have wanted Beverley to raise up and shoot the ball as he came off of the screen. However, Johnson should have been able to slow Beverley down enough for help to come. Thus, you notice that he does not drop back to explicitly take away the layup in favor of offering a 3-pointer, but goes up to the level of the screen to run Beverley off of the 3-point line. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Pop reaches the end of his rope

https://streamable.com/5x4h14

I slowed down the clip to try to read Pop’s lips as the camera catches him speaking to the players here. I think he’s saying “HEY! Can you guard somebody?” directed at either Gay, Derozan, or Mills, since Johnson is on the other side of the court.

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/svkuo0


With 5.7 seconds left, Patty Mills had two free throws to ice the game but the Clippers insisted on a replay review instants before Mills was about to shoot his first free throw in an attempt to “ice” him. Basically, the strategy is to make Mills think about the free throw more and psychologically influence him to miss it, a strategy which has been debunked before. When the refs decide to stop and review, you can hear a voice (probably Pop) yelling in the background, “THAT’S BULLS--T”. To be quite honest, Pop is not wrong since I believe the rulebook states that replays must be executed before the foul shooter sets foot on the free throw line. 

&amp;nbsp;


https://streamable.com/536dkr


At this point, Pop’s rage knows no bounds and the cameras show his next victim to be Keldon Johnson. I’ve slowed down the clip below, and it appears Pop says, “Oh, is that what you’re saying? Huh? HUH?” possibly dismissing Johnson’s attempts to defend himself. 

&amp;nbsp;

"The Denver Nuggets HAD been the brightest team with the best looking future in the NBA. This season, they are obviously off to a bad start, going 3-5 after losing to the mavericks. I believe that the two main reasons for this are the departure of Jerami Grant, but the horrendous coaching from Michael Malone. 


Malone has beet trying and forcing a 4 guard lineup, ultra small ball. These lineups have not been working at all, only hurting the team. The opposing team almost always goes on long runs against these 4 guard lineups. Also, rebounding has been a massive problem all season. How do we fix this? By putting 4 guards out on the floor, according to Malone. 


Jerami Grant decided to move to Detroit, wanting to become a larger part of the offense. He was an excellent wing defender, along with Torrey Craig, another wing who left the Nuggets. The Nuggets have repeatedly been getting pounded from deep, and it seems like opposing teams go 50% from downtown due to the lack of good wing defense. The front office replaces these players by signing 2 undersized point guards, leaving the team with 5 point guards. That's 1/3 of the entire roster, point guards.


Because of this, I don't see the Nuggets presenting a challenge to any of the top 4 teams in the west, an utter waste of the superstar talent the team has in Jokic, Murray, and Michael Porter Jr. I see the Nuggets landing at 5th or 6th seed unless there is a significant turnaround.",The Denver Nuggets' disappointing start to the season.

LeBron was of course drafted out of high school, but this is pretty bizarre.  Taj didn't even play the full 4 years at USC, only 3.

"As most people know, the current league protocol is if a player has been in contact with someone who had it, they have to isolate for 7 days at minimum (even if they have had the virus before you can get reinfected but the evidence suggests it isn't very common). You also can't get reinstated even if you have multiple negative tests in the following days. 

Obviously this makes sense to protect the other players but this has always seemed odd to me because in order to be consistent in a situation like the one with seth curry, you now have to cancel all of the sixers games for a week as the whole team has been exposed (the wizards too).

Allowing the sixer games to continue also creates the very bad precedent that it's better to have your whole team get exposed and hope no one gets it than just having one star player.

"1. They get drafted to the LA Lakers one year apart as high lottery picks. 

2. They play together on a rebuilding Lakers team, do relatively well but not exactly as good as they were hyped up to be. 

3. Both gotten rid of in replaced with a new more popular player of their position and a somewhat similar play-stye (LeBron and Lonzo) 

4. Both find their way on to a thought to be bad New York team (Nets and Knicks) and out preform and drastically improve as players becoming the surprising new leader of the team. 

5. The team out preforms expectations and 
become the new exciting fun team to watch with a new culture (with the help of new coaches (Kenny and Thibs) 

Only difference is D-Lo gets traded and the Nets acquire starpower from D-Lo (possibly what’s next for Knicks?)",The careers of Julius Randle and D’angelo Russell are eerily similar...

While Jokic isn't the best regular season performer (although this season he may prove us wrong), he always step's his game up in the playoffs. In only his second year, he made it to the conference finals, only losing to the eventual champs. Will Jokic be as good as the players I've listed here? Not super likely. Is he showing potential to be one of the best playoff performers of this era? I think yes.",[OC] Jokic's playoff stats vs HOFer's first 2 years in the playoffs
"Famed point center Bismack Biyombo has started the last seven games due to a Cody Zeller injury, and averaged 3.0 assists per game, after recording zero coming off the bench on opening night. He has recorded 21 assists in these games.

Over this same stretch, Terry Rozier, who was once seen as a point guard for some reason, has recorded 20 assists, 2.9apg.

Felt this was a stat that needed to be known by more people. Do what you like with this information.

"[Article](https://sports.yahoo.com/los-angeles-clippers-all-star-paul-george-mental-health-struggles-nba-190030411.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKYQKkV6MaMHNqVbFeSbfKHkG7z-dq_LKXTrBJKfoMFwYNUKZYm2sWa_5T7xcc3RPYRA8qfs83KIepQGR18V8JgpzsfTkfMRsFbv-7sO0r21keYMElO-2IXPWYTZcjsFEzU0BlfgEZ-nl6Ykww0LmuXn2xP4opuRrsrNS-tfd0uG)

There has to be a question of Paul George's new reputation as 'soft' is due to his openness about mental health, which this article brings up.

Paul George doesn't know where it's coming from: 
&gt; Last year was last year. I'm in a new situation; I am in a different mindset. Any of that hate stuff, you got to ask them. I don't know where that's coming from. 

Ben Rohrbach in the article directly blames this new hate on Paul George's openness about mental health.
&gt; Was George “soft” when he rebuilt himself into an MVP candidate after suffering one of the most brutal leg injuries the game has ever seen in 2014? No. Was he “soft” for taking umbrage when Cameron Payne wildly jumped on that same leg after the whistle was already blown, sparking Booker’s outburst on Sunday? No.

&gt; We all know why Booker said what he said. Except, George is not “soft” for having the courage to share publicly what others in the NBA would not. He is stronger. Mental health struggles are real, especially during the pandemic, and professional athletes are not immune. Paul himself called this his top priority as the National Basketball Players Association president over the summer. His lines on the court might be blurrier.&gt;","[Rohrbach] Paul George is back on top because he shared his mental health struggles, not in spite of them"
"So this is more about fit then anything. You want to build a team that can try to win this season. I’m gonna give you some options, use them to create a 8 man rotation(or just a starting 5 if you’re lazy). Just follow the directions and you’ll get your team.

If you did all of those you should have a total of 8 players. How is the team you just made. Who are your starters and bench guys? Is your team capable of winning a finals in today’s nba?",Follow the guideline to create the best team you can. Why did you pick who you did and how do they fit together?
I know Josh Hart plays warzone. He talks about it quite often on Twitter. Also didn’t bron play football in hs? Just interested to hear this tbh.,Best gamer/multi sports athletes in the NBA?
"I haven't.

One of the minor talking points in the bubble was that players now have a lot more space under the basket and don't have to worry about falling into clunky cameras and tweaking an ankle. I thought I would have noticed the absence of those specific camera angles, but I nearly forgot about them. The main angles they would provide are the baseline angles (used sparingly) and for halftime/post game interviews .

I think we should do away with that angle permanently and have the cameraman needed for interviews sit elsewhere.","Between the bubble and the start of this season, have you noticed the lack of baseline cameramen in terms of the camera angle they provide?"

Lowry: When people talk about the ""desire to win"", I think Lowry embodies that as much as one can. Dude is literally always finding some way to impact the game if he has the ball or doesn't. Defensively he's obviously a master charge taker, and sturdy post defender. Offensively you can trust he'll end up doing something valuable with the ball. Whether it's getting to the line, hitting a three, or finding a teammate. He does have the tendency to flop, but overall, such a joy 

Redick/Korver: Just absolute professionals who have put a ridiculous amount of work towards perfecting one skill: Shooting the ball. A shit ton of repetition and practice to become near all star level players despite lacking impressive physical tools. 

Josh Hart: My favorite player by far, the reason being that his entire game is literally effort based. Hart has genuinely below average talent. He's not a skilled ball handler, not super athletic, and doesn't have a good shooting stroke, or high court vision. The only reason at all he's a serviceable player is because he tries really freaking hard on the defensive end, bodying up bigger guys and securing rebounds like few others guards in NBA history. Even then he sometimes gets lost on defense. He basically is an example of how far 100 % effort in NBA games can get you",Under-appreciated players!
Not including the injured players obviously. But there are a few names that come to my mind immediately. What do you think?,What player do you think has regressed the most this season from last? So far anyway

He looked the best he has since the shutdown although Toronto took another L in their schedule. However if Siakam can get his shit together the Raptors might be able to follow suit. Let's see if he can continue the improved performance after his struggles since last year,"Pascal Siakam comes alive despite another loss: 32 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists on 11/21 shooting"
"When Trae Young doesn't get 15+ free throw attempts off BS foul calls, he struggles. His 3pt shot has been off all season (shooting only 33%) and without the FTs to rely on, Young struggled all night as the Hawks lose to the Hornets","Trae Young tonight: 7 points/5 rebounds/3 assists/7 turnovers on 2/9 FG, 0/3 3pt/, 3/3 FT in 35min"
"Since 2011, 40% of first overall picks were named Anthony (including Karl-Anthony). It is quite amazing how one name can be connected to such a coveted draft position. While we are yet to see how all of their careers will turn out, it seems there are some definite perks to having the moniker. In the grand scheme of things it's astounding to think that around 5.5% of all number one picks have been bestowed the same first name. This thought came to me out of the blue, but let me know if y'all have any theories......",Does Being Named Anthony Increase the Chance You're the 1st Overall Pick?

|^[boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com](https://boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com/) ^by ^/u/bazman1976 ^(original work by /u/Obi-Wan_Ginobili)|","[Post-Game Thread] The Sacramento Kings (4-4) defeat the Chicago Bulls (4-5) 128-124, behind 15 points in the 4th quarter from rookie Tyrese Haliburton!"
"I was just thinking how all the recent mvps led their team in win shares. And as I was looking through stats I saw Khris Middleton was the Bucks leader. If this kept up, and hypothetically if the bucks went 72-0, Giannis would most likely win MVP, but Middleton would be the leader in win shares. Because popularity etc etc.

Had such a case ever happened before, where the mvp didn’t lead their team in win shares?",Had there ever been an MVP who didn’t lead their team in win shares?
"We are just a few weeks into this NBA season, what is your boldest take? Before the year started, I said Bradley Beal would be 1st Team All-NBA... probably not going to happen but it was bold.",What is your boldest NBA take for this season?
"How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?  


**Actual Standings:**  


East:  


1. 76ers
2. Magic
3. Pacers
4. Celtics
5. Knicks
6. Bucks
7. Cavs Nets

West:

1. Suns
2. Lakers
3. Clippers
4. Jazz
5. Pelicans
6. Warriors
7. Kings
8. Blazers

Here was my predictions for the standings before the start of the season (bracket number is where how far that are in reality vs where I predicted them as of January 6th 2020):

**My predictions:**  
East:

1. Nets ( -7)
2. Bucks ( - 4)
3. Celtics ( - 1)
4. Heat ( -7)
5. 76ers ( +3)
6. Raptors ( -7)
7. Wizards ( - 5)
8. Pacers ( +5)

West:

1. Lakers ( -1)
2. Nuggets ( -10)
3. Mavs ( -6)
4. Clippers ( +1)
5. Jazz ( +1)
6. Warriors ( 0)
7. Rockets ( -6)
8. Suns (+7)
9. Blazers - toss up between 8/9 (+1)

1/10th of the season through, most of these picks look horrible.

I made these predictions an hour before the first game of the season. Let me know if you're curious for some of my picks or what your own picks were. For instance, for the Rockets I made the assumption that James Harden wouldn't play for the Rockets again and would be traded for some decent pieces (I was wrong).",How wrong or right are your predictions looking so far in the season?
"I suspect I'm over-thinking this, but I dislike the term 'small ball' because playing small is not the point. It's caught on because it rhymes and is relatively easy for people to picture: More small players, fewer big players.  But it's not about being small for smallness's sake, because if a team could play five big, fast, skilled, switchable guys who were all 7 feet tall, then that's what teams would do. A line-up of five Kevin Durants would be amazing. 

The point of what's commonly called 'small ball' can vary, but it's usually some variation or combination of the following:

* speed ball - fast, up-tempo play
* skill (or versatile) ball - multiple ball handlers, playmakers, shooters who can present many offensive looks
* switchable ball - similar to the previous item, but more of a defensive focus on guys who can switch without compromising match-ups

If you could rebrand 'small ball' then what would you call it instead?",What's a more accurate term for 'small ball'?
"The NBA credited Lamelo Ball with a 3 pointer with 2:12 seconds left in the 3rd quarter that was actually hit by Devonte' Graham. Here is the quote from the box score and here's a picture curtesy of a redditor below: [https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9](https://imgur.com/gallery/zfmsoH9)

"" **2:12 LaMelo Ball makes 24-foot three point jumper (P.J. Washington assists) 77-64 ""**

This shot can clearly be seen just after the 7:00 mark of the video highlights from the game (posted literally by the NBA): [https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422](https://youtu.be/YU3HJzThRWs?t=422)

Devonte' Graham made the shot - NOT Lamelo Ball.

Is the NBA trying to inflate the stats of Lamelo Ball? Or did Vegas do this somehow as the over/under for Graham was set at 11.5 and this shot would have made the over hit?

TL;DR: Graham scored 14 points this game but was only credited with 11 after this 3 was given to Ball instead of him.",Devonte' Graham had his 3 pointer incorrectly credited to Lamelo Ball
"“ Bradley Beal (4) has passed Gilbert Arenas (3) for most 50-point games in Wizards franchise history. Beal has 57 points after 3 quarters.”

[Source](https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1346999788227624962?s=21)

Beal is on fire this game. 57 (19-29FG) points through 3 quarters vs the 76ers.

https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401267269",Bradley Beal (4) has passed Gilbert Arenas (3) for most 50-point games in Wizards franchise history. Beal has 57 points after 3 quarters.
"Another thing the player shouldn’t be a second option. You can only name a player who was the first option. 



P.s. I honestly would go with lamarcus aldrige even thou in his best season from scoring perspective was only 23ppg i think he is still one of the best in this category.",Who are the besr scorers in nba history to never average more than 25 ppg in a season?
